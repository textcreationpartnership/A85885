            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Vſurpation, what it is; a Caſe propounded, wherein it is not hard to determine whether Vſurpation be chargeable, or not.</head>
            <p>USurpation is an intruſion into the Seat of Authority, a preſuming to poſſeſſe, and manage the place &amp; power thereof without a lawfull calling, right, or title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. A lawfull call or title to that rule, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is ſupreme (of which I have to ſpeak) is derived, or comes from God, <hi>There is no power but of God,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the powers that be are ordained of God:</hi> Rom. 13.1. It were a ſenſe too large, and not to be defended to take theſe words abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and unlimitedly of all power, in regard either of title, or meaſure, and uſe. An unjuſt power in regard of Meaſure, or the ſtretching of Power beyond its due bounds, or the abuſe of it is generally denyed to be of God by way of warrant; and an unjuſt power in regard of title, or an Authority ſet up, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt, or without right, God himſelf denyes to be of him. <hi>They have ſet up Kings, but not by me; they have made Princes, and I knew it not:</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8.4. Which ſpeech is by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of <note n="a" place="margin">Zanchius, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Geneva interpret. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus, Diodate: Anotations of Divines in Iocum.</note> Expoſitors applyed to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and his ſucceſſors, coming in to be Kings of Iſrael in that manner as they did; For although <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had a prediction (yea, ſuppoſe it a grant) that he ſhould be King of ten Tribes, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.29. yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at <hi>Solomons</hi> death, had no command, or direction from God to caſt off <hi>Rehoboams</hi> government, and make him their King; it was therefore ſedition, and rebellion in them; and both a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt breach of the fifth Commandment;<note place="margin">Vide Paraeum in Hoſ. 8.4.</note> and of the poſitive Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, 15. and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was faulty in that, though he had Gods preconceſſion of a Kingdom over ten Tribes; yet having had no order from him about the time, manner, or the particular ten which they ſhould be; he did not ſeek and tarry for a further direction, and calling from God; as <hi>David</hi> did in the like caſe <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 2.1.</note>. And although the Lord, when it was done, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117670:3"/> that the thing was from him <note n="c" place="margin">1 King. 12.24</note>; yet we muſt underſtand it to have been ſo by his permiſſive counſell, and generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or providence onely, as all actions as they are actions, and all events that are evils of puniſhment; and as they are ſuch, are, though the actors among men that bring them be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſinfull in them; but not by his approbation, appointment, or conſtitution; the event was from God; but not the ſinfull means by which it was accompliſhed; he ordered the evil carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of men to that effect, but he gave them no order for that evil carriage: ſo that though, in a ſenſe, it was of him; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of authorizing, it was without, and againſt him, and, in the Apoſtles ſenſe, none of Gods ordinance. But of this we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak again hereafter.</p>
            <p>God giveth a calling, or inveſts with a right to Soveraignty, either immediately, by making and declaring the choice, and deſigning the perſon himſelf; or mediately, by committing it to the people to elect, and conſtitute both their form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the perſons that are to ſway it over them, which he hath done to all Nations; yet with a reſervation to himſelf of power to interpoſe with his own immediate deſignation when he pleaſeth: and when he doth not ſo, the vote of the people is the voice of God, (ordinarily) and they paſſing their conſent when a Magiſtrate is to be ſet over them, that power, ſo conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, is of God, as his ordinance. And this may be the reaſon why that, which in one place is called the ordinance of God, is, in another called the ordinance of man, or an humane creature: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. By the former way the Judges and Kings of Iſrael had, or ought to have had their admiſſion to rule, <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 17.14.</note> and that was extraordinary, and peculiar to that people; the latter is the onely ordinary, lawfull, and warrantable way of creating a right, and title to the helme of Magiſtracy in other Nations. And as in the former the call of God was ſometimes perſonall, or of one ſingle perſon; as was that of <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Samuel, Saul,</hi> and others: and again, ſometimes lineall, or of a whole race: as was that of <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed <note n="e" place="margin">2 Sam 7.12.</note>: So it is in the latter, <note n="f" place="margin">Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Uſurpation being defined, we may proceed to diſtinguiſh of it according to ſeverall heights, or degrees it is capable of; as 1. It is either where the Throne is vacant, and undiſpoſed of (which may happen ſundry wayes, as when a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is new erected, or the poſſeſſors of the Government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, or are extinct, and none left to lay claim to it) or, where it is full, and poſſeſſed <hi>de jure,</hi> and the Rulers are onely violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extruded, and kept out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Uſurpation is either meerly in point of Title, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of a received and ſettled Government; or by way of innovating in the Government it ſelf; over-turning the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it, and forming it a new.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may come to be acted either from thoſe without, <hi>viz:</hi> Forreiners, and ſtrangers to the State; or by Natives, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Subjects of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is done by theſe, either againſt the ſingle tye and duty of obedience and Allegiance owed to the preſent lawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; or againſt Allegiance bound with Oaths and ſacred Covenants. All the ſorts of each of theſe diſtinctions are direct, and formall uſurpations, but the latter of each far ſurpaſſeth the other reſpectively, and a conſpiration of them all makes an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117670:4"/> Uſurpation of a meridian altitude; when a party owing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſubjection to a long continued, and undoubted law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power, and ſolemnly ſworn to ſubmit too, and ſupport that Government, ſhall riſe up, and preſume to thruſt out the poſſeſſors, and inveſt it ſelf, yea, and not onely ſeize on the Power; but of its own minde, and will, or, by its force alone, aboliſh the ſettled, and ſet up a new mould of government; this is Uſurpation to the culmen or height of it.</p>
            <p>Having thus found out what Uſurpation, and what the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of it is; we may put a caſe wherein it will be eaſie to give a Judgement cleerly. Suppoſe a Nation in <hi>America,</hi> whoſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall government is, and hath been anciently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly conſtituted, and placed in a King, an Houſe of Peers, and an Houſe of Commons ſitting in a collaterall, or coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rank, in regard of ſupremacy of power; the King being the ſupreme in order (unto whom, in ſuch an aſſociation, Oaths of Allegiance and ſupremacy are generally ſworn) next to him the Peers as the Upper, and the Commons as the Lower Houſe of Parliament. Suppoſe alſo, the King, according to his place, ſummoning them, and they conformably aſſembling together in Parliament, and he and they perſonally concurring to act in the higheſt affairs of government; in the proceſſe whereof differences ariſe betwixt the King, and the ſaid two Houſes; which grow to that height, as that he in perſon departs from them, a war breaks out betwixt them; the Kingdom is divided by partieſhip with them, on the one ſide or the other; the two Houſes continue acting joyntly, no: onely in managing their military defence; but in the other publick, both religious and civill affairs of the Kingdom; they petition, remonſtrate, and declare for a neceſſitie of an aſſociation, and conjunction of the King and the two Houſes as the fundamentall conſtitution, and government of the Kingdome; they enter into, and preſcribe to the people. Proteſtations, Vows, Oaths, and Covenants, for the upholding of the Authority and Power of both ſo conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: they profeſſedly fight for that aſſociated Power, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them Enemies and Traitors, they proſecute them with fire and ſword, ſequeſtration of eſtates, and other puniſhments, that go about to divide them aſunder, or oppoſe the aforeſaid Authority; and all this they do, and avow as the indiſpenſably
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117670:5"/> neceſſary diſcharge of their truſt. Suppoſe after all this, the Army raiſed and imployed by the ſaid two Houſes in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid war, confederating in their Leaders (as by the immediate ſequell manifeſtly appears) with a ſmall party in the Lower Houſe; Remonſtrates to that Houſe (without any addreſſe to the other) many high and ſtrange things they would have done by them, and amongſt the reſt, that the King be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, as for treaſon, and other capitall crimes; in like manner his two eldeſt Sons, if they render not themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a day to be ſet them: that it be declared that the peoples Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives in the Houſe of Commons ſhall have the ſupreme Power, and all other ſhall be ſubject to them; in which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that Houſe not being ſo obſequious to them as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but ſtanding upon the collegueſhip of that Government, which they with their aſſociates, the King, and the Houſe of Peers are intruſted with; the Army, forthwith, marcheth up to the doores, and by force of Arms ſeizeth on, and ſhuts up in hold one ſort of them; and by a ſtrong guard ſet at their doores ſhuts out another, ſuffering onely a ſmall number of them, and ſuch as pleaſe them to ſit in the Houſe. Suppoſe laſtly, this little number, left in the Houſe, ſhall approve of, and ſecond theſe proceedings of this Army; and by their act, or Vote confirm the ſecluſion of that greater number of the Members of that Houſe; and, taking upon them to Act in the name of that Houſe, ſhall Enact or declare themſelves to be the onely Supreame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Nation, and by that pretended ſolitarineſſe, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of power ſhall take away, and aboliſh the other Houſe of Parliament, deſtroy the life of the King, deny, and diſanull the Title of his Heirs, and Succeſſors, to the Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; aboliſh the office of a King, and ordain and govern ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily over the people, as their onely ſupreame Power, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their obedience, and ſubjection as to ſuch. The <hi>quaere,</hi> in this caſe thus propounded is, whether this ſaid party, as thus acting, and as to this latitude of Authority, be uſurpers, yea, or no? whether this their removing others from the Seat of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Power, and aſſuming it peculiarly to themſelves, be, or be not Uſurpation (as Uſurpation hath been before preſcribed) and that to the very apex, or higheſt pinacle of it; yea, whether they be, or be not guilty of a double Uſurpation?</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:117670:5"/>
            <p>Firſt, in uſurping the name and Authority of that Houſe. It may haply be ſaid for this. 1. That poſſibly they may make a <hi>quorum,</hi> or as many in number as are required to act. <hi>R:</hi> But are they not ſuppoſed to be under actuall and preſent force, which hath been, without contradiction by any, adjudged a ground of nullity to Parliamentary proceedings. For though all are not required to be preſent, yet the Houſe muſt be free for all to come to, that their acts may be free and authorative.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, That perhaps they may be moſt willing, voluntary, and free in their acts, and the force that hath taken away others may be no force but a ſecurity to them, being of the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, apprehenſions, and deſignes with them. <hi>R:</hi> But though they as men may be free, yet taking upon them the name of the Houſe, are they free as an Houſe? the Houſe includeth virtually every Member of it, many whereof being violently excluded by thoſe that guard the meeting place, how free ſoever thoſe perſons are that ſit, how can the Houſe be ſaid to be free? nay, doth not their voluntarineſſe and free complyance make the Uſurpation compleater? Could they be ſaid to be enforc'd to declard, and act ſuch things, we might by a favourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, onely judge their Acts to be null; but when their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings flow from their own wils, and they ſo concur to the excluſion of others more then themſelves from the exerciſe of the power they with them are intruſted with, and aſſume to themſelves a power, never confirmed on them by the people, but meerly of their own creation, how can this be leſſe then Uſurpation to the life?</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, In uſurping (in the name of that Houſe) the ſole ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Power in the Nation. It will be pleaded: perhaps, that the Houſe of Commons, in the ſuppoſed caſe, is the onely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the people, to whom alone the Nation hath committed the Supreme Power. <hi>R:</hi> 1. That Houſe is not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the whole Nation, but onely of the Commons, which though the bulk, and far more numerous part; yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand for the whole in chooſing a Repreſentative, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for themſelves. 2. If it could be made good, that to that Houſe, the whole Nation, in the originall conſtitution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, had committed the ſole Power; the <hi>quaere</hi> would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be caſt in the negative: but how will that be proved? The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117670:6"/> caſe, at it is put, preſuppoſeth Antiquitie, and by paſt practiſe: and the actings of the preſent Houſe of Commons, untill brought under force, to proclaim the quite contrary. 3. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>ab origine,</hi> can be ſhewed for that, did the King that ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned this Parliament, or the People that choſe this Houſe of Commons, ſuppoſed in the Caſe, paſſe over any ſuch preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to them <hi>de novo;</hi> If either of them did, let us hear how. 4. It is too groſſe an abſurdity to be charged upon the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed preſent, and all former Repreſentatives; that being intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the people with the ſole Supremacy, they have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aſſociated to them the King, and the Houſe of Peers, it being beyond the power of the conſtituted, and onely in the Conſtitutors to make ſuch an alteration in the fundamentall Conſtitution; as Repreſentatives cannot make Repreſentatives or Proxies, ſo can they not take in Aſſociates, or advance others, not impowered by them that impowered them into a Collegue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them. I leave it therefore to every Reader to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Caſe, and paſſe Judgement. Whether the ſole ſupreme Power, in the preſuppoſed party, be derived to them legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, or be not a Self-created power, and ſo a meer Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that of the fulleſt dimenſion; being againſt a lawfully ſettled Government, in prejudice both of the juſt Magiſtrates and the people: and in contradiction to both the ſingle tye of Subjects Allegiance to Soveraignty, and the ſacred ſanction of Vows, Oaths, and Religious Covenants.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117670:6"/> opinion in the Title of their Diſcourſe for obedience as lawfull; yet, in the proſecution, they plead for it in that fulneſſe of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude as due, and neceſſarie.

            <p>I begin with the former; wherein it is aſſerted by one of the foreſaid Authors <note n="a" place="margin">A Diſcourſe, wherein is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. &amp;c. by <hi>Ant: Aſhcam</hi> Gent: Part. 2.

And if poſſeſſion was really the trueſt evidence to us of their</hi> (to wit, the expelled Princes) <hi>rights, then it is equitable to follow it ſtill, though it be perhaps in a perſon of more injuſtice then they were.</hi> And the other book, I before cited, <hi>(viz: The lawfulneſſe of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent Government)</hi> maintains the ſame thing (both
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117670:7"/> whoſe arguments, for what they ſay, I ſhall take notice of, when I have layed down mine own ſenſe and Reaſons) I ſhall therefore here labour to make good theſe two things: 1. That meer forcible extruſion deprives not any lawfull Magiſtrate of his right and title to ſupreame Power. 2. That violent poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives no right to the Seat of Authority; and conſequently the Subjects allegiance is not turned about by the changes of powerfull poſſeſſion, and diſpoſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Forcible extruſion or diſpoſſeſſion diveſts not of Dominion, that the ſtate of the Subjects allegiancec ſhould be altered by it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if the vindication or recovery of a Princes, or peoples right of Dominion, out of which he, or they are ejected, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded be a juſtifiable ground for his, their, and others in their behalf leavying and waging war, and proſecuting with the ſword thoſe that withſtand the ſaid recovery; then the right of him that is expulſed by force is not cancelled, or diſanulled. The reaſon of this conſequence is of it ſelf evident, for nothing can be the ground of a war but a juſt and reall title, either to be defended, or recovered; but I aſſume, the recovery or redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Princes or peoples right to a Kingdome with-held, or wreſted from him or them, is a juſt ground of drawing the Sword, and commencing a war. This is proved (if it needeth any proof) by the war of the Judges &amp; people of Iſrael, againſt the Kings and Nations that at ſeverall times invaded and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over them; againſt whom they roſe up, and reſcued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Dominion of their Land from them: the ſtory of which acts, we have in the <hi>book of Judges,</hi> and by the warres of <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> againſt the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> recorded in the 1. <hi>Book of Samuel:</hi> as alſo by <hi>Davids</hi> warlike undertaking againſt, and ſuppreſſion of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who had carried away all <hi>Iſrael</hi> after him, into a Rebellion againſt <hi>David,</hi> &amp; expulſed him out of the Land, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. &amp;c. and 19.9. In like manner by <hi>Jehoiada's</hi> and the peoples riſing in Arms againſt <hi>Athalia,</hi> the uſurping Queen,<note place="margin">1 Macca. chap. 1. &amp;c.</note> in the right of <hi>Joaſh;</hi> and their ſuppreſſing, and deſtroying her, and enthroning him by force of Arms. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. And by the wars of the <hi>Maccabees againſt Antiochus, Epiphanes, and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ioſeph. de Bell: Iudaic. lib. 1. cap. 1. Cron. Carion. lib. 2.</note> And the many undoubtedly lawfull wars of other Princes and States in ſuch cauſes as theſe, which to inſiſt on is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in ſo clear a matter.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:117670:8"/>
            <p>Secondly, If right and title to Soveraignty be not built upon poſſeſſion, but upon the Law of the Land, or other conſent of the people, then it is not loſt by diſpoſſeſſion; this conſequence is founded upon that which a learned Statiſt <note n="h" place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions touching a warre with Spaine, written by <hi>Francis</hi> Lo: Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ulam, &amp;c. pa. 3d.</note> ſaith, <hi>Is a received maxime almoſt unſhaken, and infallible, Nihil magis naturae conſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum eſt, quam ut iiſdem modis res diſſolvantur quibus conſtituantur: There is nothing more agreeable to nature, then that things ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the ſame means they are conſtituted.</hi> From which he infers, very pertinently to our caſe in hand, <hi>That if the part of the people, or Eſtate be ſomewhat in the Election, you cannot make them nulloes or ciphers in the prorivation or tranſlation.</hi> But the right and title of Soveraignty is not built upon poſſeſſion, (which the proof of the latter Poſition will clear) but upon the peoples conſent, which hath gone for ſo currant an axiome, eſpecially of late, that it will certainly paſſe without contradiction.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If a private property be not loſt by loſſe of poſſeſſion, neither (or rather much leſſe) can ſuch a publique property be loſt by that means; there can be no ſuch difference made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them as to enervate this conſequence, and however, who ſees not the incongruitie of this, that that which is the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory and protection of a private mans property, ſhould be of a ſo much more ſlipperie tenure then it; but a private property is not loſt by diſpoſſeſſion, if it were, for what uſe ſerveth the Law, or Magiſtracy? one main end of which hath been, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Subjects right from uſurpation, or what call you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty? But he that either hath any, or granteth ſuch a thing to be as property, will let this aſſumption paſſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If violent extruſion take away a Soveraignes right, then rebellion where it proſpers and prevails is no treaſon; for there can be no treaſon, or other crime imputed as againſt the Crown, dignity, or authority of them, whoſe right therein is extinct and null; ſo that they are onely (according to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) traitors or rebels, that riſe up in Arms, and rebellion againſt the lawfull Power, and do not ſucceed and ſpeed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſires. By this account, treaſon and rebellion ſhall conſiſt, not in the maliciouſneſſe of the intent or attempt; but in the misfortune of ſucceſſe, or impotency of the proſecution of it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If force diſſolve Magiſtracy; then that prohibition of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117670:8"/> 
               <hi>reſiſtance under pain of damnation: Rom.</hi> 13.2. is in vain, in that it concerns onely them that cannot reſiſt effectually, and is no more then if he had ſaid, reſiſt not ye that want power to do it, leſt if ye do, ye incur damnation: for they that have power, and pleaſe to uſe it to the depoſing of the Magiſtrate, being that in ſo doing they put an end to his right, how can guilt remain on them?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Violent intruſion into, and poſſeſſion of the Seat of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority gives no right to it; and conſequently neither draws allegiance after it, nor evacuates it in relation to another.</p>
            <p>Firſt, an unjuſt action cannot produce, or create a right. <note n="i" place="margin">Non eſt ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum ut ex actu injuſto, ius ſibi quis acquirat D.

Sect. 4.</note> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good, and evill are at ſuch diſtance, that the one cannot be the cauſe, the other the effect; but violent intruſion into Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is an unjuſt action: <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Man who made me a Judge,</hi> &amp;c. and that whether it be by one that ſhould be a Subject to that power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 5. <hi>Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. or by a Forreiner, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.12.27. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, If violent occupation made a right; <note n="k" place="margin">O pubes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitura Deos, quodcunquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videtis pugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do dabitur: praeſtat victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria mundum. Cl. Claudiani Giganto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.</note> then it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any, that could make a ſufficient ſtrength for it, to riſe up in Arms, invade, and ſeiſe on any Kingdome or Territory, he can prevail over; yea to kill and deſtroy men and Countreys for Empire and Dominion, as <note n="l" place="margin">Cicero ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens de officiis tertio libro ſemper Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem in ore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buiſſe Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis verſus, quos ſic ipſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertit: nam ſi violandum eſt ius regnanti gratia violan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt. aliis rebus pietatem colas Sucton. in lul. Caeſ.</note> 
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> inclined to hold; for that which is of it ſelf the way and means to place a man in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſtate, or calling, and makes him a lawfull poſſeſſor of it, muſt needs be lawfull: but it cannot be held lawfull for any, that can finde power, and advantage, to invade Crowns and Countreys, as is evident by the proof of the Aſſumption of the preceeding Argument.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, If poſſeſſion by power give a title; then its unlawfull for an oppreſſed Prince, or people to raiſe warre, or uſe any other means to expell an Invader, or remove ſuch as have come in, and hold meerly by force; for its unlawfull to reſiſt, or fight againſt a juſt Magiſtrate, <hi>Rom</hi> 13.1, 2. But it is lawfull for an oppreſſed Prince or people, by Arms, or otherwiſe to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from a forcible Uſurper, as manifeſtly appeareth by thoſe preſidents given in the proof of the aſſumption of the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the former Propoſition, to wit, the wars of Iſrael
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117670:9"/> in the book of Judges, and 1. of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of <hi>David, Jehoiadah,</hi> and the Maccabees, and by the known Law and practiſe of all Nations, and conſent of all Divines, and Chriſtians, who with one vote allow defenſive and recuperative Arms, excepting the Anabaptiſts, and ſome ancient Hereticks of their ſtamp.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, All force ought to preſuppoſe a right in that about which it is converſant; whether for the defence or recovery of its <hi>wars</hi> (ſaith <hi>Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions touching a warre with Spaine. pa. 2d.</note> &amp;c.) (I ſpeak not of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious predatorie wars) <hi>are ſuits of appeal to the tribunall of Gods juſtice, when there are no ſuperiors on earth to determine the cauſe, and they are as civill Pleas, either Plaints or Defences:</hi> Force therefore cannot create a right, ſeeing it is to follow it, and both give it the precedencie in time, and own it as its ground-work; Adde to this, that the Sword is committed to the Magiſtrate (<hi>and to him alone,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>

The Sword makes not the Magiſtrate, (that is, <hi>it is not its principle of Generation,</hi>) but the Magiſtrate <hi>à warranto</hi> authorizeth the Sword; the ſword may make for his conſervation, but not for his Creation.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, If force give a title <hi>(renitente populo)</hi> then that late ſo much decantated Aphoriſme, All Power (to wit, Authority) is from the People, muſt be called in again; yea all Donations, Elections, Compacts and Covenants betwixt Prince and people are void, and null buſineſſes. A third perſon that can get hold or power, and liſts to uſurp, may diſſolve and evacuate them all; yea the Prince that comes in by them, when once he hath poſſeſſion of the Power, holds by his power, and not by them, and can no longer, nor further look to retain his right to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then he can enforce it; and what Turkiſh and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call practiſes doth this doctrine put him upon of neceſſitie, if he will ſit faſt.</p>

            <p n="7">7ly, Power and right, as alſo poſſeſſion and right, are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as all experience demonſtrates; ſo it was in the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betwixt <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and ſo it frequently happens to be: ſucceſſe and victory doth not ſeldome follow the wrong party; and he would be thought irrationall amongſt all men, whereſoever in the world, but where reaſon it ſelf is brought under tyrannie, that ſhould ſay, ſucceſſe is the onely Arbitrator of Controverſies of right, and is ever infallible.</p>
            <p n="8">8ly, Strength and Authority alſo are two diſtinct and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things, and rarely meet in the ſame ſubject, but where ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bruitiſhneſſe, or all miſeries prevail; man hath dominion given him over the beaſts, many whereof are (and were by creation) ſtronger then he; What is a Generals natural ſtrength to that of the Army over which he commands?

The ſenſe then which this Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion puts upon this text is catachreſticall, and it gloſſeth the words ſo, as to be an incouragement to reſiſt the power, for he that reſiſteth the power proſperouſly (according to it) poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth juſtly that ordinance of God, and in truth purchaſeth to himſelf (not damnation, but) domination.</p>

And in this ſtate of things, to leave every man free, to make over his allegiance by himſelf, is to open a doore to more diviſions then ever yet were in any Age, or Nation, and would confound all, not an heptarchy;

            <p>I Now come to enquire into the other opinion before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz:</hi> That one may ſubmit, and act under a uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power, for the time, and during the intervall of its preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; with reſervation of allegiance, as due and cordially devoted to the lawfull Power expulſed. And about this we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117670:13"/> ſhall not inſiſt long, becauſe we finde not much conteſtation or difficulty.</p>
            <p>In regard of the juſtnes, and neceſſity of ſome things which may be the ſubject, or matter of the Uſurpers command, and the Arbitrarineſſe of others, and the lawfulneſſe of either, not depending upon the command or warrant of a ſuperior, but reſulting out of the nature of the action it ſelf; ſo that a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man might do it, were there no Magiſtrate to command it, or no command from the Magiſtrate for it. We muſt needs grant, there are things which may be done upon the Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers command or injunction, (though not becauſe or by vertue of it) for the command of him that unwarrantably aſſumeth power, cannot, by it ſelf, make that unlawfull which were lawfull if that were not. For inſtance, the performance of acts of common equity, charity, order, publick utility, and ſelf-preſervation is requiſite: ſuppoſe it be in concurrence with a Uſurpers command, and in thus doing we do materially, but not formally obey him; the ground of acting, in ſuch things, being not at all any relation, or principle of ſubjection to him; but conſcience of obedience to the will of God, and due reſpect to others, and our own ſafety, and good. Under this ſort of actions I comprehend:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Taking up Arms for the preſervation of our ſelves and the Countrey againſt a common Enemy, upon the Uſurpers ſummons; the which we might do of our ſelves, were there no Authority; or if a juſt Authority were in being, yet if it could not, or did not, maturely enough call us forth to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

In this point Mr. <hi>Aſcham,</hi> the afore named Author, (Part. 2.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117670:14"/> unjuſtly; and I may receive my money, with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, from the hands of a thief that is willing to return it to me, though he took it by robbery, from another thief that robbed me of it; and if the party, with whom I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie for my right, will agree to refer the matter, betwixt us, to a private perſon as an Arbitrator, and ſtand to his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement; that is a lawfull means of coming by my own, though by his help, and award that hath not claim of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over me; my ſubmitting therefore my private right to the judgement of an uſurping Magiſtracy, is no placing or owning a publick power of judicature to be in him. It hath been ordinary (and there is no doubt of the lawfulneſſe of it) for a Souldier to ask quarter, a priſoner liberty, a man his plundered goods of his Enemy: yet in all this there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of a legall power in that Enemie to be a Judge over the ſaid Petitioners, either in caſe of life, goods, or liberty; onely in the form of addreſſe to the Uſurper, we had need be caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that ſuch a ſtyle be not uſed as will be a plain conceſſion of his title to the power which he uſurps.</p>
            <p>But, in granting liberty of concurrence with ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of an uſurped Authority, we neither yeeld any obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all to be due, or performable to it; nor can we allow a correſpondence with it in divers things, and therefore we are to put a difference.</p>
            <p>Firſt, betwixt things that are in themſelves neceſſary, and thoſe that are of a middle or an indifferent nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered. In the latter, though, in ſome caſes, I may act upon the Uſurpers injunction; as our Saviour payed tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute where he was not bound to it, to avoid ſcandall; yet I muſt be cautious, 1. of owning, juſtifying, or upholding the uſurpation, or injuſtice of the party commanding, the very appearance whereof I muſt as much as I can avoid. So did our Saviour, in paying the tribute gatherers their demand, by declaring his freedome, and the conſideration upon which he payed, <hi>viz:</hi> not the equity of the demand, but his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to prevent ſcandall. And therefore in the obſerving of a duty of Religion, neceſſary in it ſelf, and appointed, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable Authority, to be kept on ſuch a ſet day, which is in it ſelf, arbitrary; the beſt way is, to take another day for it,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117670:14"/> for the ſhunning of the appearance of the evill of obeying an unjuſt power. 2. Of doing any thing that I may foreſee will bring a worſe ſcandall being acted, then the omiſſion of it would; it being required of a Chriſtian, where ſcandall-take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lyes both wayes (as not ſeldome it doth) to ſhun the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that is of worſe conſequence, which is uſually that which is more generally taken, or by perſons more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or worthy of tender reſpect. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Judaiſme in <hi>Peter,</hi> and others at Antioch, practiſed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a few, where the moſt part were Gentile Chriſtians, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. &amp;c. but admitted it at Jeruſalem, where the greater ſort were beleeving Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.20, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Betwixt morall, or prudentiall acts competible to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, or ſubjects, and politicall acts, or judiciall proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that flow from power, and Authority inherent in the perſon that acts them, or are the iſſues of diſtributive juſtice, and either come forth from a perſon clothed with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or unto which is requiſite a ſtamp of Authority to make them lawfull, and juſtifiable: as to bear the office of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or Commander in Civill or Military affairs, or to be any under Agent, or ſervant in carrying on, or aſſiſting the Government. An Uſurper, in giving out Commiſſions, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or Warrants for proceedings of this nature, I conceive may not, in this kinde, be obeyed. Men are not to act as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate rulers, or agents, under ſuch a power, or as ſent by him as ſupreame in the Apoſtles ſenſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Uſurpers authority being indeed null, and of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he being in truth but in a private mans capacity, as to the power he aſſumes; he cannot communicate, or derive any authority unto me, whereby I may act, that which before I could not; ſo that thoſe actions, which require the ſeal of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make them lawfull, and which without it would be irregular and ſinfull, it muſt needs be clearly unlawfull for me to do, by vertue of his Commiſſion. Conſcientious adviſed men will generally judge it preſumption, violence, oppreſſion, bloodſhed, reſpectively for a private man to take upon him of himſelf, to impriſon, chaſtiſe, amerce, or put to death any ſuppoſed, or really manifeſted malefactor; and if I have no other humane warrant but the Uſurpers, it leaving me but in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117670:15"/> a private mans capacitie, will leave my actions of that nature under no better a character. If I ſhould, being about ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, be asked that queſtion of our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Man, who made thee a judge, or a divider over us?</hi> What ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would it be to him that ſo enquireth, or to mine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to alledge the name of the Uſurper, who, as to ſupreme Authority, and conſequently to the making of a competent Officer of Juſtice, is as good as no body.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, So to act would make me a uſurper alſo, and bring me in to be a partner in the ſupreame uſurpers ſins; in as much as politicall or State inſtruments, to wit, their ſubordinate agents, ſhare together with the ſuperior in the morall qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the work of Government.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, This were manifeſtly to uphold, and maintain Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thus I ſhould contribute aſſiſtance and ſupport to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt power, and oppoſe the right of him, or them againſt whom he holds it; they that favour this kinde of acting as requiſite, in regard of the ſubjects protection, and ſafetie, ſeem not to conſider, that a ſubordinate officers acting looketh upward, as well as downward; and he that is ſuch a one to the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſerves his turn of ſubſiſtence in an unlawfull poſſeſſion as much, or more then the ſubjects benefit. For firſt, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth and juſtifieth his authority as ſufficient and valid by officiating under, and by it. 2. He keeps up that authority, and extends it to as many as he hath to do with. 3. He gives an example and encouragement to others to embrace and propagate it, as he himſelf doth. 4. He layes an ingagement upon himſelf to ſtand or fall with the Uſurper; and ſo to do his utmoſt for him. 5. He involves himſelf, either wittingly, or blindfoldly in a concurrence with thoſe counſels, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which both in their own nature, and in the intention, and projection of the Uſurper, directly tend to the Uſurpers eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and the impeachment of the lawfull Governors claim, and re-advancement.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe grounds, and the like, the ſecluded and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned members (in the caſe ſtated, Chap. 1.) had need be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed well before they enter, or act among the preſuppoſed Uſurpers: though they might be admitted by them without queſtioning, or purging, I queſtion how they can enter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117670:15"/> amongſt them without ſelf-ſoyling: though they ſhould, in going in, reſolve to act honeſtly, yet, I ſee not how they can be untainted in a conceſſion with thoſe, who in their preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion or totality, aſſume a power not legally in them, and act legiſlatively, and otherwiſe in the higheſt ſphere of Supreamacie: a force being upon the Houſe, and the majority of Members, and the Authority of the King, and the Lords-Houſe being profeſſedly excluded by them. They that are out may do well to reſolve, before they joyn, how it can be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them that ſit to act at all (though never ſo juſt things) the whole, or body, to which they belong, being ſo mangled in its Members, and manacled in its freedome. And, if at all they may act, how according to Law, conſcience, and their Oaths and Covenants, they can govern in that ſolitarineſſe of ſupreamacie, and depoſition of their compeers: if they think theſe things unjuſtifiable in them that ſit, have they not cauſe to be warie how they involve themſelves in ſuch mens actings, whileſt they ſtand in that poſture? Beſides, that they in coming in help to ſtrengthen the uſurpers by increaſing their number, and giving them countenance in the eye of the Kingdom, as much as if they in all things concurred with them; for without the Houſe, who knows how men ſway, or give their votes? And, on the other hand, they weaken and much prejudice the claim of the lawfull Power, by appearing on the contrary party, putting themſelves into an incapacity to act for it, as otherwiſe they might, and ingaging themſelves to aſſiſt, or at leaſt, not to oppoſe the Uſurpers.</p>
            <p>Finally, let them recollect, before they enter that doore, what they have ſworn to his late Majeſtie, his Heirs, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Succeſſors; what to the Parliaments Power, rights and priviledges, and what to the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Et magnum ſit <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> The obligatorineſſe of the Oaths and Covenant, urged in the 2d. Chap: againſt obedience to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, made good againſt divers late Authors.</head>
            <p>BEfore I take in hand to anſwer Arguments that are brought for the confirmation of thoſe two opinions for obedience to Uſurpation, and againſt which I have argued in the preceding Chapters; it will be convenient in this place to take notice of ſuch allegations and Exceptions, as are made againſt the obligation of the Oaths and Covenants before ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as binding out from that obedience: ſundry late Authors having pleaded that the Oaths, and Covenant either are not now in force, but expired, or do not extend too, and binde in the caſe to which they are applyed. I begin with the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance preſented to the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Novemb:</hi> 20. 1648. which unto the clauſe in the Solemn League and Covenant, Art: 3. obliging <hi>to endevour to preſerve and defend the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties perſon and Authority, in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion, and liberties of the Kingdom:</hi> alledgeth divers things, ſome of which concern onely the obligation to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings perſon, thoſe are paſt conſideration, other reflect upon it in relation to his Authority, as unto which I have urged it to be ſtill in force, and therefore ſhall examine what the Remonſtrance ſaith for the invalidating of it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, bringing in onely ſo much of its argumentation, as can be conſtrued to tend to this purpoſe: and of this nature I obſerve two Allegations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The words (in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms) are a restriction to the engagement for preſervation of the Kings perſon, and Authority, ſo as to oblige them to no further, nor in any other way then ſhall be conſiſtent with the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and defence of the true Religion, and liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but if by reaſon and experience we finde the preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his perſon to be not ſafe, but full of viſible danger (if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly destructive) to Religion, or publick interest, then ſurely (by the Covenant itſelf) the preſervation of his perſon or authority is not to be endevoured ſo far, or in ſuch a way, or at least the Covenant obligeth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117670:16"/> not to it, but against it:</hi> page 55, 56.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not neceſſary nor proper to take the words, in the preſervation, &amp;c. as reſtrictive to the engagement either way, that is either for the preſervation and defence of the Kings perſon and Authority on the one hand; or of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdoms on the other: It is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie (I ſay) for thoſe words in the Article (in our ſeverall voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) are an expreſſe, and fully ſufficient reſtriction, taking in, and binding to all lawfull and juſt wayes of preſerving and defending each of them, and excluding all unlawfull. Neither is it proper, [in] there being clearly conjunctive, and as much as [with] and equally looking both wayes, that is, both to the preſervation and defence of that which goes before, and that which follows, unto the preſervation and defence of all which (though they be not of equall worth or intreſt, ſo that one of them muſt come behinde the other in the order of our endevours of their preſervation and defence, yet) the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant binds equally (in regard of the firmneſſe of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) yet if any ſhall ſtill contend, that clauſe to be reſtrictive in that manner which the Remonſtrance ſaith, I will not ſtrive in a verball contention with him; for the taking of it ſo no more leſſeneth our obligation to the preſervation of the Kings Authority, then if it had not been inſerted; we being tyed notwithſtanding it, to all juſt wayes of preſervation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and no more had been involved if it had been left out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the ſinews of this Argument lyeth in the pretended or implyed inconſiſtency betwixt the preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Religion and the Kingdoms liberties; unto which I ſay:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is doubtleſſe a fair conſiſtencie, non-oppoſition, or agreement betwixt the ſafetie of every one of theſe, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of each of them may and can ſtand with the other, it is a groundleſſe ſurmiſe, and groſſe abſurditie to imagine an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency betwixt the juſt intreſts of any of them, our taking of them together into the Covenant yeeldeth thus much; if there were any incoexiſtency amongſt them, we could not have ſworn to their joynt preſervation; or if we did, the Oath was of impoſſibles, and ſo (as to this branch) both unlawfull and void, or non-obliging in the making of it <note n="a" place="margin">Regula juris rei impoſſibilis nulla obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:117670:17"/>2. An endevour to preſerve the one and the other will well enough ſtand together; a lawfull power indeed actually and effectually to preſerve them all may happen to be wanting, and any one of them may fall under danger, and I may want juſt means to relieve it, but an endevour (which can onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a doing what is within power and warrant) may be yeelded ſtill to the preſervation of every of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Seeing then that an inconſiſtibility either of the things one with another, or of the endevouring their preſervation cannot be pleaded as poſſibly incident or occurrent, evident it is, that there cannot at any time lye a neceſſitie of taking a way of any of them, and that the obligation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the endevour of preſerving every of them continually ſtands in force during their reſpective exiſtence, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it bindeth out from intending, ſeeking, attempting, or proſecuting the aboliſhing or deſtruction of any of them; for that is indeed truly inconſiſtent with the ſaid endevour, and therefore a palpable violation of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>It muſt here be granted, that the lawfull and neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and preſervation of one of them, ſometimes may ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy me that I cannot at that time by the ſame means act for the others ſafety; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> what I act for one, may put the other in hazard, and in the iſſue not onely be accompanied with, but (though againſt my will, and endevours to the utmoſt of my lawfull capacity) contingently, and beſides my intention prove the loſſe and ruine of the other: and this is incident not from any contrariety or inconſiſtency that is betwixt them, but both becauſe they are diſtinct, and ſeparable things, and ſo cannot alwayes, and by the ſame medium be concurrently proſecuted: and becauſe ſome of them are more worthy then the other, which muſt therefore have the preheminency thus far, that if they cannot altogether with my beſt endeavours be ſecured, I am to prefer the ſecurity of the moſt precious, and expoſe any of the other rather to danger then it. As for inſtance, it will (I ſuppoſe) be admitted to be agreeable to the Covenant, for the Kingdoms rather to omit the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarding of their Liberties, and put them to the hazard then the true Religion,, where both cannot be joyntly put out of danger: but all this amounts not to a diſobligement from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117670:17"/> the endevour of preſerving them all; nor to a liberty upon any emergency of active, direct, and purpoſed making away, or removing of any of them, though under pretence of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the other. I have read of one <hi>Alcon,</hi> who finding his ſon faſt on ſleep upon the graſſe, and a Serpent creeping upon his breaſt, he not apprehending how otherwiſe it was poſſible to ſave his ſon, took his Bowe, and ſhot at the Serpent upon the boyes breaſt, which (though to the manifeſt endangering of his life) yet the choſe rather to take that courſe, then by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Serpent to leave his life to a more certain deſtruction; and either his art or good hap was ſuch, as that he prevented and ſlew the Serpent, and preſerved his Son: <note n="b" place="margin">Ars erat eſſe patrem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. But how doth the Remonſtrancer prove the Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz: The inconſiſtency pretended betwixt the endevour of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Kings perſon and Authority, and the preſervation of Religion and liberty?</hi> thus he ſaith, <hi>By reaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, and experience we finde the preſervation and defence of his perſon and Authority, to be not ſafe, but full of viſible danger (if not certainly deſtructive) to religious or publick Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the one could be ſaid to be certainly deſtructive to the other, you would have ſaid it without an <hi>[if not]</hi> but it ſeems you have not confidence to aſſever ſo much, and yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be purely inconſiſtent without ſuch a deſtructiveneſſe; ſo that your own extenuation ſufficiently diſcovers the weaknes of your proof; all that you affirm is, <hi>That there is no ſafetie, but a full viſible danger</hi> in the preſervation which you impugne.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The danger you pretend is in the diſpoſall and uſe of the things to be preſerved, not in the nature of the things. For inſtance, the Kings Authority is politically and morally good, the ordinance of God, and if well uſed may be eminently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious; if evilly uſed may be dangerous enough to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and liberties: the like may alſo be ſaid or the privileges of the Parliament, and of the liberties of the Kingdoms in relation to Religion, and to each other; will you thence infer an inconſiſtency of theſe with Religion, or a diſobligement
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117670:18"/> from the Covenant for preſervation and defence of theſe?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As there may be danger that way to the things ſpecified, ſo there may be danger and inſecurity to the ſame things on the other hand, <hi>viz:</hi> in the deſtruction of the Kings perſon (ſuppoſe it were undone) and Authority, and let impartiall Reaſon and Experience judge, whether the preſervation or deſtruction thereof hath more danger in it to Religion, and the Kingdoms Liberty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſeeing there may be ſome danger on each ſide, and in the preſervation of the Kings Authority, there is no more pretended but danger, and that but of ſuffering, not of ſin, it is apparent, that as there is no ſuch inconſiſtency as is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo the obligation of the Covenant to the preſervation of the Kings Authority ſtands good, and our ſafeſt way is to avoid the horrid ſin, and greater danger of Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by ſtanding upon the ſaid preſervation.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, The other thing which the Remonſtrance alledgeth, and is to be cleared is this. <hi>Where ſeverall perſons joyning to make a Covenant, do make a covenanting clauſe therein to the good or benefit of another perſon not preſent, no party to the agreement, but whom, and whoſe Intereſt they would willingly provide for as well as for their own, to the end be might joyn with them in the agreement, and partake the benefit thereof as well as themſelves, if this abſent party (when it is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to him for his conjunction) ſhall not accept the Agreement, but refuſe to joyn in, and oppoſe it, and begin, proſecute and multiply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts with all the Covenanters about the matters contained in it. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that perſon in ſo doing by his once refuſing upon a fair and full tender, ſets the other Covenanters free from any further obligation, by vertue of that Covenant, as to what concerns his benefit or intereſt therein. Now whether this be not your caſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. True indeed, a releaſement from Covenants and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory oaths, which concern matters betwixt man and man is granted lawfull ſome wayes: But, 1. this muſt be done by the party with whom the Covenant, and to whom the Oath is made <note n="c" place="margin">Si is cui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur ratum habuerit iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A releaſement can be made by the party covenanted with and ſworn too, onely where the Covenant is for the particular and proper intereſt of that party, or ſo far onely as concerneth him, but not to the prejudice of a third parties concernment without his conſent <note n="d" place="margin">Dico ſexto, relaxationem partis valere ad vinculum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenti ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendum, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ipſius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men valere in praeiudicium tertiae perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae.

Ibid.</note>; but the Covenant (even in that part of it) was not meerly or chiefly of a private or perſonall importance to the King himſelf, but was, and is of a publick intereſt to the Covenanters themſelves and the Kingdoms; the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall therefore and oppoſition to it could be no releaſe from it: we ſay on all hands, the King is for the Kingdom as the means is for the end. <hi>We have ten parts in the King,</hi> ſaid the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of <hi>David;</hi> and at another time they ſaid and ſware, <hi>Thou ſhalt no more go out with us to battell, that thou quench not the light of Iſrael. What portion have we in David? and we have none in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the ſon of Jeſſe,</hi> the ten Tribes ſaid, when they made a revolt from, and rebelled againſt <hi>Rehoboam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Introduction of the Covenant in laying down the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments and ends for the making of it, expreſſeth it ſelf thus: <hi>Having before our eyes the glory of God, and the advancement of the kingdom of our Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, the honour and happineſſe of the Kings Majestie, and his posterity, and the true pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick liberty, ſafety, and peace of the Kingdoms wherein every ones pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate condition is included.</hi> And a little afterwards, <hi>We have for the preſervation of our ſelves, and our Religion from utter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, reſolved, and determined to enter into a mutuall and ſolemne, League and Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. And Art: 6. it ſtyleth its cauſe, <hi>This Common cauſe of Religion, liberty and peace of the Kingdoms: which cauſe,</hi> it ſaith preſently after, <hi>ſo much concerneth the glory of God, the good of the Kingdoms, and honour of the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The King never refuſed to agree to, nor did he oppoſe the matter of this particular clauſe: as touching this there could be no diſſent on his part, his preſcribing and ſtanding
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117670:19"/> upon the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, wherein this clauſe is contained, his avowing the difference and war on his part to be for the defence of his perſon, and authority; his putting forth Oaths to them that adhered to him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of theſe, makes it as clear as noon-day that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and oppoſed not this branch. Now upon this confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Remonſtrancer hath not onely failed in his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but overthrown his own argument; he ſaying in the place before cited, <hi>Although the Kings refuſing ſets the Covenanters free from any further obligation by vertue of that Covenant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to what concerns his intereſt and benefit therein, yet the Covenant as to other matters concerning the right and benefit of the Covenanters one from another ſtands ſtill obliging, and in force.</hi> I may by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſay, the Kings refuſing the Covenant upon exception againſt other clauſes, not this, and his oppoſing other matters in the Covenant, not this, could not diſ-ingage or releaſe the Covenanters from this, about which there was not the leaſt diſſent or reluctancy, but a concurrence full enough on his part; ſo that the Covenant muſt ſtand ſtill obliging and in force as to this part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the Kings ſaid refuſall and oppoſition could have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged us from this member of the Covenant as to his own perſon and intereſt in the Authority, yet with all your ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you cannot ſtretch them to our releaſe from preſervation and defence of the Kingly Authority in relation to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who were in proximity to him intereſted in it; and for whoſe intereſt therein the Covenant was alſo made <note n="e" place="margin">Having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the honour &amp; Happineſſe of the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and his poſterity.</note>; and whoſe refuſall of it, nor yet a tender of it to them, you do not, cannot once plead.</p>
            <p>I have done with the wrong gloſſe of the Remonſtrancer endeavouring to impeach the obligation of this clauſe of the Covenant. I finde another (a deare friend of his) tampering with it alſo to clude the tye of it; and he offers it no leſſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but in a more unhandſome and groſſe manner. It is that Polemick, or Army-Divine, Mr. <hi>J.G.</hi> in his Defence of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Sentence, &amp;c. The man in that book undertaketh, and bends his skill to a double unhappie, and croſſe deſigne, to wit, to varniſh and guild over that which is very foule, and to beſmear and obſcure that which is very clear. In his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117670:19"/> of the latter he fals upon this ſentence of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in dealing with which he correſpondeth with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrancer, and as this hath challenged to himſelf a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to enforce men and Magiſtrates, ſo doth he arrogate to himſelf to be a bold enforcer of words and Covenants; a more ſtrange and preſumptuous perverting of plain words, I never read nor heard, then that which he uſeth to this clauſe, when he ſaith, page 51. <hi>Evident it is, that thoſe words in the Covenant in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion, and liberties of the Kingdoms, import a condition to be performed on the Kings part, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the performance whereof, the Covenant obligeth no man to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or defence of his Perſon or Authority.</hi> And this condition he makes to be, page 52, 53. <hi>That he preſerve and defend the true Religion, and liberties of the Kingdom:</hi> and of this his paraphraſe of the words he ſaith, <hi>If this be not the clear meaning and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them, the Covenant is a Barbarian unto me, I underſtand not the Engliſh of it.</hi> The vaſt exorbitancy, audaciouſneſſe, and impietie of this his wreſting, and ſtraining of theſe plain words, I leave the Reader to take the meaſure of: I ſhall onely endeavour to free them from this his diſtortion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let the words themſelves ſpeak, they do not ſay in his preſervation and defence, &amp;c. but in the preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, &amp;c. plainly referring to the ſame preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Religion and Liberties which is before promiſed, and ſworn in this and the preceding Articles, and as evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the ſame perſons preſervation, and defence of them here, which are to preſerve and defend them in the former clauſes, and which are to preſerve and defend the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties perſon and Authority in this, <hi>viz:</hi> the Covenanters. If the Covenant had intended to pitch the preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in this clauſe upon another perſon, or perſons, as the performers beſides thoſe to whom the ſame actions are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red immediately before, it would have pointed them out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly; but when it expreſſes no other, ordinary conſtruction will attribute them to the parties before nominated; and no regular conſtruction can put them upon any other. This read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is plain Engliſh to him that knows the language, and will underſtand, and Mr. <hi>G.</hi> proves himſelf a barbarous dealer with the covenant, in that he will have it, either to admit of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117670:20"/> his antigramaticall ſenſe, or to be a Barbarian to him. I dare appeal to Mr. <hi>Gs.</hi> own conſcience, if it be not either ſpeechles, or a Barbarian to him, whether, when he took this Covenant, he underſtood this clauſe in the meaning he would now thruſt upon it; or rather hath not played the <hi>Doedalus</hi> ſince, in ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and bringing forth this ſenſe to ſerve his turn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend what hath been ſince acted.</p>

In making this the importance of thoſe words, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> contradicts his friend, or Patron the Remonſtrancer, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of them, and takes away the very medium, or ground of his argument before brought in out of his book, page 55, 56. and anſwered above. For he page 55. takes thoſe words either <hi>as a restriction to the engagement for preſervation of the Kings perſon and Authority, to wit, as obliging no further then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent therewith:</hi> yea he propoſeth whether the ſaid engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not be ſo underſtood as <hi>to be fulfilled in the preſervation of Religion and Liberties;</hi> neither of which ſenſes can carry that clauſe to the King as the performer: and in page 56, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth <hi>this preſervation, and defence of Religion, and liberties</hi> to be <hi>the Parliaments Covenanted utmoſt endevour to preſerve them.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>J. G.</hi> then leave endeavouring to reconcile the Covenant and his cauſe which are at too great odds to be reconcileable, and go make the Remonſtrancer and himſelf friends, who differ ſo diametrically in their ſenſe of theſe words.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How will Mr. <hi>G.</hi> make this ſenſe of his, and the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the late King ſtand together? for before the King was ſo proceeded againſt, he had conſented to all that was poſitively propoſed to him for Religion, at leaſt for 3. yeers; and for the privative part propounded, to wit, the Abolition of Epiſcopacy he had not denyed it, but granted the preſent ſuſpenſion, and referred the utter extirpation of it to the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration of the Aſſembly, and ordering of Parliament; againſt whoſe conſent he had agreed nothing ſhould be done for the reſtoring of it: and had granted fully the Parliaments over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for Liberties. Neither doth the Remonſtrancer, or any other (as far as I have obſerved) inſiſt on the ſhortneſſe of the Kings conceſſions in any particulars of either nature, as the ground of thoſe capitall proceedings, but on the inexpiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his former facts, and the unſafeneſſe of truſting him
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117670:20"/> for future upon any tearms. If then the King, immediately before the fatall proſecution againſt him, did (as his preſent ſtate would permit) concur ſo amply in the preſervation of Religion and Liberties, they were bound that had taken this Covenant by vertue of this clauſe taken in Mr. <hi>Gs.</hi> ſenſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had been his former carriage) then to endeavour the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his perſon and Authority. The Covenant in this branch is indefinite, and unreſtrained in regard of time; it doth not ſay (ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Gs.</hi> meaning had been its words) we ſhall preſerve the Kings perſon and Authority, if he ſhall (within a yeer or two after this) preſerve Religion, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; but obligeth the Covenanters whenever the King ſhould joyn in preſerving Religion and Liberties (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> underſtandeth it) to the preſervation of his perſon and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Here then Mr. <hi>G.</hi> inſtead of weakning the Covenant, as to the end it was urged by thoſe whom he oppoſeth, hath by wringing turned it againſt himſelf, and that his adored cauſe which he would have defended, and that with more ſtrength then is in any of thoſe reaſons (or rather ſhifts and colours) brought by himſelf or any other <hi>Roſcius</hi> — for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If that indeed were the ſence of that clauſe which he would out-face us into the accepting of, what can be ſaid againſt the binding of it to the preſervation and defence of the kingly Authority ſtill? (though the then King be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) it being before proved, that this clauſe obligeth to it in reference to the Kings poſterity, againſt whom there can be Objection of a fail in this ſuppoſed condition, it being unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable without default whileſt poſſeſſion of the Authority is with-held; and the Authority being with-held before, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any refuſal of the ſuppoſed condition, by him that ſhould perform it, or any overture to him, for the obtaining of it be made.</p>
            <p>I have thus done with the exceptions made againſt the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatorineſſe of the Covenant, in the matter in hand; I now paſſe to the Examination of what is pleaded againſt the force of the Oaths of Allegiance amongſt the impugners of them; Ile begin with him whom I had laſt to deal with, Mr. <hi>J.

But, 1. they cannot do it as the party ſworn to in that Oath, for they are not that partie in the Oath, the King, and his Heirs, and Succeſſors are the onely perſons to whom, and in whoſe behalf the Oath is taken, and conſequently they onely that can releaſe from it as parties; nay they are the party ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore far from a capacity of diſcharging others from that Oath, as preſently I ſhall ſhew. 2. Neither can they do it as a ſuperior by the equity of that Law, <hi>Numb:</hi> 30. For, 1. their lawfull ſuperiority in the caſe they now ſtand, is the matter under queſtion. 2. The power of a ſuperior to undo the Oath, or bond of the inferior, prevails onely in thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherein the party is under the power of the ſuperior, and not in other matters, which are without the extent of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors authority <note n="l" place="margin">

But however the ſuperior can onely by the Law cited, or any other right come in to make void the Oath of the inferior, which was taken without his knowledge and conſent, and that alſo he may onely do in the day that he hears of it; but if he either allow the making of it, or declare not againſt it preſently, when he comes to know of it, he hath no power thenceforth to recall it, as is clear by the Text. Now the Oath of Allegiance was ſo far from being diſallowed, or declared againſt as ſoon as it was known, that it was inacted and injoyned by both Houſes of Parliament, and moreover it was conſtantly to be taken by all the Members of the Lower Houſe at their entrance into that Houſe; ſo that beſides their incompetency to diſcharge from the Oath who have aſſented to it; Let any man ſhew how they who are parties to the oath, and have themſelves taken it can diſanull it; the obliged parties diſanulling is a ſtrain above Papall diſpenſation.</p>

But if it be onely of that nature which they call impeditive of a greater good, that is, if it ſtand in the way (not of the good of the Kingdom ſimply, and abſolutely reſpected, but onely) of ſome higher degree of good ſuppoſed to be attainable; this conſideration will not bear that weight, as to fruſtrate an oath. As for example, when a people that hath ſworn obedience to a lawfull form of Government, which yet is not abſolutely the beſt, as ſuppoſe to a Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or Ariſtocracy, or that hath ſworn obedience to a lawfull Prince, who yet is not ſimply the ableſt that can be found for regall parts and qualifications, ſuch may not take themſelves diſcharged from their Oath, becauſe there may be a better modell of Government, or a better qualified perſon to make a Prince ſound out, and for that cauſe caſt off their preſent Government and King, and ſet up another becauſe compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively better. It was doubtleſſe better for the people of Iſrael, that the Gibeonites had been deſtroyed, as the reſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites were (if there had been no oath to the contrary) then that they were ſpared (beſides that the ſparing of them was againſt an expreſſe poſitive Law: <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.16.) and ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation judged, and therefore grudged at the ſparing of of them: yet in that caſe the Oath for ſparing them ſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.15.18, 19. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1, 2, &amp;c.

You have not yet produced any former Princes that had any hand in the making of a Law, that came into the regall Authority meerly by power; for although ſome of them got poſſeſſion by the Sword, yet (to omit the alledging of other title) they were confirmed, by the Kingdoms conſent in Parliament, before they concurred in Enacting Laws for the Kingdom. 2. The Laws you reflect on were not meerly made by thoſe Princes whom you pretend to have come in meerly by Power, but were conſtituted by Parliamentary Enacting; And for any former Parliaments coming into the Authority meerly by force, you neither do nor can alledge any thing.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Author in theſe lines raiſeth much duſt, that it may ſerve him for a double end: 1. To obſcure the genuine ſenſe of this clauſe of the Oath, that it may not ſeem to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as indeed it doth; and then to detort and wreſt it, to the advantage of his Uſurpers intereſt. 1. He would caſt a miſt upon the words of the Oath, to over cloud its true ſenſe, and this he attempts in the fore-cited Diſcourſe untill you come to this mark ‖: he endeavours it by placing an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117670:26"/> in the word [Succeſſors], and ſetting it at odds with the word [Heirs] whereas this clauſe of the Oath is clear enough in it ſelf, and far enough from the uſe he would make of it; and firm enough to the ſenſe which he oppoſeth. Which that I may evince, I deſire the Reader to obſerve theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Oath intends by Heirs, and Succeſſors, the ſame perſons which may evidently appear, 1. By the manifeſt drift of the Oath, and intention of the Authority that preſcribed it, which is the continuance and aſſurance of the Crown (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conceſſion of his then Majeſties juſt title) to his Heirs in ſucceſſion after him, and one another lineally, and the defence of them therein againſt all other corrivals or oppoſers; this I cannot ſee which way will be gainſayed; and being ſo, it will inforce us to grant the Oath, and Oath-giver, could not mean by ſucceſſors any other then heirs. 2. In that the words <hi>[heirs and ſucceſſors]</hi> are joyned by the copulative [and], whereas if they ſhould have intended different parties, the diſcretive <hi>[or]</hi> ſhould, in true ſyntaxis have been put betwixt them. 3. In that his heirs and ſucceſſors are immediately in the Oath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted by the ſame pronounce <hi>[them],</hi> and again by the ſame poſſeſſive <hi>[their]</hi> in thoſe words, (<hi>and him and</hi> [them] <hi>will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend to the uttermost of my power, against all conſpiracies and attempts whatſoever, which ſhall be made against his or [their] perſons, [their] Crown or dignity</hi>) but if they be not the ſame perſons, how come they to be thus particled together? eſpecially how can they immediately after his Majeſtie be inſtituted to the ſame Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and defence therein in relation to the ſame Crown and dignity; admit them divers, and the Oath will import a contradiction: and will any man imagine, ſo irrationall a thing as that Authority hath ſo long impoſed, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, eſpecially the moſt intelligent perſons in it, have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally taken an Oath ſo irreconcileable to it ſelf. 4. The Law of the Land (unto which this Oath muſt needs be yeelded to be conſonant) ordains his Heirs to be his Succeſſors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Oath underſtands by Succeſſors, thoſe onely that are ſo <hi>de jure,</hi> and not any others, that contrary to right may intrude into the royall Seat, and injuriouſly make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſucceſſors onely <hi>de facto.</hi> For, 1. In the Oath we ſwear Allegiance, and defence to Succeſſors; now what man of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117670:26"/> would ever impoſe, or take an Oath of this nature to any (but in his intention) a juſt party, for to ſuch a one alone could he ſwear in righteouſneſſe according to <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. 2. The Oath appropriates the Crown and dignity to Succeſſors, as theirs, in theſe words, <hi>[their Crown and dignity]</hi> now theirs, and their right are all one. 3. The Oaths of Allegiance, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy muſt needs accord, and this may be the beſt Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorie of that: now this, <hi>viz:</hi> the Oath of Supremacy prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the word <hi>[lawfull]</hi> to Succeſſors, and confineth our allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his lawfull Succeſſors in theſe words, The Kings high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his Heirs, and lawfull Succeſſors: which epithite will not permit the word Succeſſors, either in that or in the Oath of Allegiance (unleſſe you will unreaſonably make them jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) to be carried to any ſucceſſor but him that is ſuch of right. And this reaſon will alſo irrefragably confirm the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Propoſition, <hi>viz:</hi> that the Oath intends by Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, the ſame perſons, for who are his lawfull Succeſſors? the Law will tell you, his Heirs.</p>
            <p>By theſe two Propoſitions (ſufficiently cleared I hope) we may underſtand how the Oath (in that clauſe) binds; and that, 1. There is no ſuperfluitie in the word <hi>Succeſſors;</hi> for an Identity in ſenſe of divers words is no vain Tantalogie, many words ſignifying the ſame thing being ordinarily uſed (and eſpecially in Oaths, and ſuch like punctuall forms, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the Oaths of Allegiance, and Supremacy in divers other clauſes) for explication, and ſignificancies ſake. And though heirs and ſucceſſors in the clauſe in hand mean the ſame perſons, yet it may be in a divers conſideration, as thus: They are Heirs in his Majeſties life time, and Succeſſors at his death reſpectively. 2. That the Oath binds neither to his Heirs, nor Succeſſors disjunctively, or the one taken from the other, but to both conjunctively, as one: and taking Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors aright, that is, for lawfull ſucceſſors, we need not, cannot ſay that it binds either to a ſucceſſor that is not an heir, or to an heir that is not a ſucceſſor, <hi>viz: de juce,</hi> though perhaps he may be prevented, or delayed from actuall ſucceſſion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But this Author will have [Succeſſors] to ſignifie ſuch as are ſo <hi>de facto,</hi> and do actually ſucceed in Government; And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117670:27"/> by this means this paſſage of the Oath ſhall make for the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper if he be in poſſeſſion. I have ſaid (I think) that which is enough to fore-ſtall this alreadie, but let his Argument be heard, and receive a formall Anſwer; it is in effect thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The common and ordinary acception of the word Succeſſor, means him that actually ſucceeds in Government; but the word Succeſſor in this Oath, muſt be underſtood in the common and ordinary acception: Ergo, the word Succeſſor in this Oath must mean him that actually ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer to the major by denying it if taken univerſally; and if it be not, the Syllogiſme is falſe: the major not being univerſall in the firſt figure. For although one common ſenſe of the word Succeſſor, is he that actually ſucceeds whether by right or wrong, yet that's not the ſole uſuall acception of the word, and this I ſhall evince the ſame way that he goes about to prove his acceptation to be the common one; and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, confute alſo his proof of his major which is thus. <hi>If you would know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the common ſenſe of the word Succeſſors, ask not ſo much Lawyers and learned perſons, as men of ordinary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and demand of them who was</hi> William <hi>the Conquerours ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor? they will ſay,</hi> W: Rufus. <hi>Who ſucceeded</hi> Rich: <hi>the</hi> 3d: <hi>they will ſay,</hi> H: <hi>the</hi> 7th: <hi>and yet neither of them was heir. R.</hi> Although I yeeld not his rule to be the beſt (for if Succeſſor be a tearme uſed in the Law (as it is in this Oath preſcribed by Law) Lawyers, and learned men in the Law, were there any obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would be the fitteſt Interpreters of it; for it is a maxime, we muſt beleeve every one in his own facultie or Art <note n="p" place="margin">Credendum eſt cuilibet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifici in arte ſua.</note>) yet I ſhall refer the matter to it ſo the queſtion may be rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and as the caſe in hand will allow. This Author propounds it fallaciouſly, and unapplicably to the preſent purpoſe, in that he demands <hi>de praeterito,</hi> and ſo as the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely interrogates of an actuall Succeſſor [who was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, or did ſucceed ſuch a one?] and then the anſwer (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made by men learned or unlearned) muſt needs bring in him that did ſucceed in fact. But let the queſtion be put <hi>de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo,</hi> and thus onely it is ſutable to a promiſſory oath which reſpecteth the future time, and a thing to be done in it; and conſequently to this Oath which is promiſſory, and runs <hi>de futuro. I ſhall bear faith and true Allegiance; and I will defend,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117670:27"/> and was taken of a ſucceſſor not that had ſucceeded, but that was to ſucceed, and it will be this, <hi>who is to be his Majeſties ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor?</hi> and then let even the man of ordinary knowledge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it, and ſee whether he will not ſay, not every one that can catch it, but he that hath right to the Crown. And by this fitting of the queſtion to the current of the Oath, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution that the thing it ſelf gives to it, as the proof of his Propoſition is taken off, ſo the contradictory to it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inferred, to wit, that the ſole, common and ordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the word Succeſſor, is not him that actually ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in Government. But if the word Succeſſor be capable of a divers acceptation, what obligation can there be to ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in the Oath? R: Although Succeſſor in common uſage may be taken two wayes, to wit, either for a ſucceſſor in fact, or a ſucceſſor in right, yet in the Oath it can be taken but in the latter ſenſe. For, 1. It is a rule for the finding out of the ſenſe of an Oath agreed on among Caſuiſts, that in Oaths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, or impoſed by others, we muſt conſtrue them in that ſenſe which is known, or may moſt probably be judged to be the preſcribers <note n="q" place="margin">

With the word Heir, which being placed firſt in the Oath, muſt firſt be ſerved; and ſucceſſor can be onely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in congruity with it. 3. With the Oath of Supremacy, which bindeth us to the lawfull Succeſſors. 4. With the Law of the Land, which appointeth ſucceſſion to the Heir. 5. With a poſſibility of keeping the Oath, for if heirs and ſucceſſors mean divers perſons, how can the Oath of Allegiance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Regall dignity be obſerved towards both?</p>
            <p>Having vindicated this paſſage of the Oath of Allegiance from this Authors diſtortion, I cannot let him paſſe without without a brief animad verſion or two more. 1. Whileſt he contends about the ſenſe of Succeſſors, and would have it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117670:28"/> underſtood of actuall ſucceeders, that it may favour the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers, he forgets what is the object of that ſucceſſion, <hi>viz:</hi> a Crown, and regall dignity, wherein by vertue of that Oath thoſe Succeſſors are to be defended: wheras they whoſe power he pleads for, (and in whoſe behalf he undertook to anſwer this clauſe, as not forbidding obedience to them) have not onely put by the rightfull Succeſſor, but aboliſhed the Crown and Regall dignity it ſelf; unto what then would he have his mecenates to be ſucceſſors? or how will he reconcile obedience to them with defence of the Crown, and royall dignity? 2. It is to be admired, that a perſon of ſo fair a character (as is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the worthy Authors of the <hi>Religious Demurrer</hi>) ſhould begin this Section of his with a generall deliberative, <hi>(It were good to conſider, whether there be any clauſe in any Oath or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which forbids obedience to the Commands of the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,)</hi> and yet take no notice of any thing in this or the other Oaths and Covenants, ſave of this clauſe onely in this Oath, which it ſeems he thought he could not onely looſen from obliging againſt him, but draw over to be accident to him, which how well he hath performed, I leave the Reader to conſider. And I further admire how (ſeeing he accounteth <hi>Oaths ſacred bonds, and reverend obligements</hi>) he feared not to uſe ſuch enforcement to the clear letter of ſo tender and ſacred a thing; for though any body can ſay a tyrant <hi>ſine titulo,</hi> or a Uſurper is a Succeſſor <hi>de facto</hi> when he is in, yet that he is ſuch a ſucceſſor as the Oath intends, <hi>viz:</hi> one that we are ſworn in allegiance to, and are bound by that Oath to defend to the uttermoſt of our power, &amp;c. Having withall (probably at the ſame time) ſworn in the Oath of Supremacy Allegiance to the lawfull Succeſſors, and to our power to aſſiſt, and defend all juriſdictions, priviledges, &amp;c. belonging to thoſe Succeſſors, is a groſſer interpretation, then I hope he himſelf will own when he conſiders it, or any conſidering and conſcientious men can receive. And I could wiſh he would conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he took the Oath he had this ſenſe in his minde, or rather it be not newly excogitated, upon the coming into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of theſe late tranſactions; and how neerly this practiſe entrencheth upon perjury <note n="r" place="margin">Alterum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurii genus eſt ubi recte jura. veris, non ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerè agere, ſed novo aliquo excogitato commento iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenti vim (ſalvis tamen verbis) decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare &amp; cludere D.

            <p n="4">4. But having ſaid what he thinks fit to the clauſe, he will
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117670:28"/> have one glance at the urgers of it. <hi>Yet withall this quaere may be added, while the ſon is in the ſame posture in which the father was, how comes this Oath at this time to ſtand up, and plead for diſobedience in regard of the Son, that was aſleep, and ſilent in regard of the Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They that plead this Oath for diſobedience, or rather denying obedience to the preſent Power in regard of the Sons right, did the ſame in regard of the Father; when it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that not a meer defence of Religion and Liberties, and a recovery of the Kings perſonall preſence to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the end of the war, but the Fathers death, and the Sons diſ-inheriting, with the deflowering of the Crown, and over-turning of the Throne it ſelf. Witneſſe (amongſt other teſtimonies) what the <hi>London, Eſſex, Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Banbury</hi> Miniſters have declared publickly in their reſpective writings, they are alike ſworn to, have according to their power and vocations, ſtood for the Authority of both, and not allowed the depoſition of either, or the uſurpation of their Power by others: they have prayed againſt, bewayled, ſtood aſtonied at, witneſſed againſt the proceedings that have been againſt both of them: and to this day they lament that the clear Word of the Lord, held forth by their teſtimonies, hath not prevailed for the prevention or retractation of thoſe direfull, and (the world throughout) ſcandalous courſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Son cannot yet be in the ſame poſture his Father was in, whileſt an overture or propoſall for ſatisfaction hath not once been made to him, wherein he is in the view of the Kingdom more harſhly and extreamly dealt with then even his Father was; and as his Fathers ſufferings as to life were without preſident, ſo are his as to ſucceſſion to the Crown.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Aſhcam</hi> (whom I had in hand before, Chap. 2.) hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtrange, and unapproveable paſſages reflecting upon the Oaths under debate; which I ſhall cull out as I meet with them in ſeverall places. In his 2d. part, Chap. 8. Sect. 6. he layes down foure Caſes, wherein he ſaith, Subjects are freed from their ſworn Allegiance. His three firſt, (<hi>viz:</hi> 1. If a Prince abandon. 2. If he alienate. 3. If <hi>Nero</hi>-like through mad furie or folly, he ſeek in an hoſtile way the deſtruction of his whole Kingdom) will I preſume be taken not to concern our caſe in hand; the fourth poſſibly may be judged applicable to it,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117670:29"/> which therefore I ſhall take notice of: and a brief animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will ſerve, he delivering it (as he doth other odde and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound ſtuffe) with a pythagoricall magiſteriouſneſſe, and without the aſſiſtance of reaſon to induce a perſwaſion to it in the Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the Prince have part of the ſupreame right, and the people the other part, then notwithstanding an Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to him, he may be oppoſed if he invade the other part of Supreame right.</hi> And a few lines after he affirms with <hi>Grotius, He may loſe his right by the Law of War.</hi> And in the next Section he ſaith of all thoſe foure Caſes, and therefore of this, <hi>That they ſhew how we are abſolved in our own conſciences from all Oath and Contract, when one party forfeits his Conditions first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The defenſive oppoſing of a Prince, invading his Compeers part by the party invaded where the Supreame right is ſo ſhared, (ſuppoſing the Oath of Allegiance to be cautioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſharing) I ſhall not diſpute, it being beſide the preſent queſtion; but his loſing his right by the Law of War; and the Subjects abſolution from Oath upon that his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forfeiture of conditions, I ſhall a little call into queſtion. 1. He tels us (if we will take it upon his word) if the Prince invade the others right, he may loſe his right by the Law of War. What the Law of War means (if diverſe, or varying from Gods, and other humane Laws) I underſtand not, nor is it materiall; in diſcerning into the permanency, or ceſſation of right, and of an oath concerning it, we are to have recourſe to the Law of God, and Nature; and if by theſe the Princes title, and Subjects oath remain firm, notwithſtanding his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the peoples right, the Law of war like <hi>Alexanders</hi> Sword may violently cut in ſunder, but it cannot unlooſe either the ſingle tye of right, or the ſuperadded of an oath. How ſhould this forfeiture come? if any wayes, by way of ſatisfaction for the treſpaſſe upon the others right. But theologicall Juſtice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points not, that where one invadeth anothers right, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders right ſhould thereupon be cancelled; and that it may be lawfull for the invaded, upon that injury received, to inveſt himſelf therewith, and finally to alienate and diſpoſſe him of it. A liberty of defence it permitteth to the Invaded in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his own right, and a proſecution of the Invader unto
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117670:29"/> his full ſatisfaction for the wrong inferred by him, and for that end (if there be no other mean but war left to effect it) the invaded (if he have power of war) may ſeaſe the Invaders right unto a juſt recovery or reſtitution of his own; but that being compaſſed, and proportionable ſatisfaction for the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe being given or gained, the Invaded party muſt ſit down therewith, and not extend his line over all his late Invaders right. Every tranſgreſſion towards man cals for ſatisfaction; and whoſo doth wrong, is bound to make reparation; and his right is reſponſible, or obnoxious ſo far: but it is more then <hi>ſummum jus</hi> to carry this compenſation to a totall and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall tranſlation of the Injurers poſſeſſion to the Injured: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall confiſcation is too high a penalty to be ſet upon every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment. Look into the laws and rules of ſatisfaction in Scripture, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.4, 5. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.8. and it will appear the deepeſt amounts but to a foure-fold reſtitution of the damage. Nay look into that order (which comes home to our Caſe) concerning the Princes of Iſrael, who having formerly uſed oppreſſion, violence, ſpoil, and exaction towards the people of God, are not therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be deprived of their whole Inheritance (Office, and all) but are onely reduced to their own portion: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.7, 8, 9. But becauſe this Gentleman flies to the Law of War for this his extreame dealing with Princes, hear what a learned Judge, and profound Stateſman delivers, in the caſe, in relation to that very rule. It is the Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> who (inſiſting on the juſtneſſe of a war on the King of <hi>Englands</hi> part with <hi>Spaine,</hi> for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> although the <hi>Paulſgrave</hi> in whoſe behalf that war ſhould be commenced, ſhould be accounted to have made an unjuſt war in <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching war with Spaine, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the right honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Francis</hi> Lord Verulam pag. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> by means whereof he came to loſe the <hi>Palatinate</hi>) reſolves thus: <hi>An offenſive warre is made, which is unjust to the Aggreſſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt aggreſſor, which is now turned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, ſhall he ſit down, and not put himſelf in defence? or, if he be diſpoſſeſt, ſhall he not make a war for the recovery? No man is ſo poore of judgement as will affirm it.</hi> This reſolution he confirms with many inſtances worthy to be peruſed in the Author; and in the end with this Reaſon: <hi>Wars are vindict; revenges, reparations;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117670:30"/> but revenges are not infinite, but according to the meaſure of the firſt wrong or damage.</hi> And within a few lines after he ſaith of the caſe he is arguing: <hi>It is the more clear on our part, becauſe the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Bohemia is ſettled with the Emperour. For, though it be true, that</hi> Non datur compenſatio injuriarum, <hi>yet were there ſomewhat more colour to detain the Palatinate, as in the nature of a Recovery in value, or compenſation, if Bohemia had been loſt, or were ſtill the ſtage of War.</hi> According to the rule of Juſtice then, yea even that of War, the peoples right being recovered, and ſatisfaction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or tendered for the ſecuring of it for future, the late inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Prince ſhould injoy his right again, and the oath that was given for the ſecuring of it ſtands in force, and obligeth to it. And this may be further cleared, in that the Solemne League and Covenant was preſcribed, and taken when the King was judged to be in the actuall invaſion of the peoples rights; when the people could not be reaſonably required to ſwear the ſaid Covenant in behalf of the Kings right, if ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion did forfeit it, and abſolve the Subjects from their oaths to him; and if they did then ſwear, they cannot afterward plead an abſolution from their Oaths by vertue of that inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And if the late Kings actions could be a forfeiture of all rights, and diſſolution of all Oaths as to himſelf (which I cannot yeeld) yet how can either of them be ſaid to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled in relation to his Heir, upon whom the right legally deſcends, and unto whoſe title the Oaths were ſworn. If it be ſaid, he was partaker in the ſame actions, the <hi>Religious Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> will tell you,<note place="margin">2. part. pag. 8.</note> that the right and title to the Crown upon his Fathers death, doth quit him from all ſtain by the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Whereas he would infer this abſolution from all oaths, <hi>by the Princes forfeiture of his Conditions first.</hi> What Conditions doth he mean? 1. If he underſtand any conditions to be in the Subjects Oaths which are to be fulfilled by the Prince, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which tearms the Subjects Oaths ſhall binde, he is beſides the book; the Oaths of the people put no conditions upon the Prince, but are all abſolute and irreſpective, and run without ifs, or and's; in like manner as the obligation of Subjects al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to their Soveraigne is irreſpective according to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, as I have before (in this Chap.) proved. If
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117670:30"/> this Author fancy any ſuch conditions in the peoples Oaths, let him ſhew where they lye, and what they are. 2. If he mean conditions in the Kings Oaths of Government, they are alſo unconditioned, or not dependant on tearms to be kept on the Subjects part: and, as the Subjects miſcarriage is not a releaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King from his Oath of Government, ſo the Kings failing is no diſcharge of the Subject from his Oath: the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, or obligation of either cannot be ſaid to hang on the performance of the other; unleſſe it could be proved that each part ſwore with reſpect to the others obſervation of his duty and oath, which neither the tenor of the Oaths, nor the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of them will permit to be granted; nor hath this or any other Author that I have ſeen, ſaid any thing to prove that.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, If by conditions he mean the capitulations which the Kingdom may be ſuppoſed to have made with him at his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallment in the Throne, upon the keeping,<note place="margin">At ſi duo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines mutuo ſe obligent promiſſis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſi generis, aut non codem tempore, aut alias citra mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum: violata ab uno fides non liberat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione; ſed uter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tenetur id ſervare quod ipſe juravit, etiamſi alter qoud ſuarum erat partium non effecerit, exempligratia.

The truth is, it is a weak error, though ſomewhat apt to poſſeſſe the minds of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering men, that in thoſe eſtates of life ordained of God for the help of man, wherein there is a mutuall relation, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable offices to be performed (as of Magiſtrate, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; parent, and childe; husband, and wife, Maſter, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) where there is a departure from duty on the one ſide, there is a ceſſation of the debt of duty on the other. If this were ſo, it were a frivolous thing for men, ſubject to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to contract any relations; and there would be no place left for the exerciſe of gentleneſſe, patience, charity, betwixt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, nor for the inferiors paſſive obedience in caſe of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie;

The Proteſtation of the 5. of <hi>May,</hi> 1641. is a Vow; now Divines reſolve, that though an Oath may be cancelled by the party to whom it is made, yet a Vow no man can remit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is made to God as the party, and no man hath to do in altring the right wherein we are bound to him.

            <p n="2">2. His other way he thus layes down. <hi>A man cannot by Oath be obliged further to any power, then to do his utmoſt; and the Oath is to be underſtood conditionally, if the action, or paſſion may be for that Powers advantage. In an Army each man being obliged by Oath to loſe his life for the Prince, rather then turn back, or avoid any danger; this Army having done its utmoſt, is beaten; and now the Souldiers can do no more for their Prince then dye; in theſe ſtraights therefore it is not repugnant to their Oath to ask quarter, or a new life, and having taken it, they are bound in a new and just obligation of fidelity to thoſe whom they were bound to kill few houres before. They who live under the full Power of the unjust party, may be ſaid to take quarter, and to be in the ſame condition with the former: and ſo have the liberty to oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that which the Prince now cannot but expect from them, viz: to ſwear to thoſe under whoſe Power they live, that they will not attempt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:117670:32"/> any thing againſt them. All that this amounts to is, it is</hi> praeter, non contra prius juramentum; <hi>and as the condition which is the ground of this promiſſory Oath is ſuch, that it is impoſſible for a man in it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his parties cauſe, ſo it is impoſſible for him to be bound to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility.</hi> Here is much ſtrength of confidence in aſſerting, but none of Reaſon to a warrant, and prove what is here intended to be concluded. That a Souldier, or Subject, being ſworn to ſerve his Prince to the utmoſt of his power, may ask, and take quarter, and paſſively ſubmit to a captivating Enemy, when he is fully under his power, I ſhall not call into queſtion; his Oath binding him to do what he can, for his Soveraigne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids him not to yeeld when he can do no longer; and for him to ſuffer death, or harder uſage by conteſting with his enemy, when he lyes at his mercy, as his Oath binds not to it, ſo it is for his Princes diſadvantage, there being yet hope that his life may be reſerved, and his liberty recovered, for his Princes further ſervice according to his Oath, in regard whereof he is rather in that caſe bound to ask, and take quarter, then bound out from it, but what of all this? will it thence follow, <hi>That the Souldier, or Subject thus brought under an adverſe party to his Prince, oweth fidelity, and may oblige himſelf by Oath to that party not to attempt againſt him?</hi> If his Allegiance and Oath were expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there were ſome probable way for it; but here is little ſaid, or can be ſaid for that. Let us particularly examine, what this man alledgeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath done what he could, and the Oath bound him to no more. <hi>R:</hi> He hath done what he could hitherto, and ſo far hath kept his Oath; but if the Oath was (as the Oaths in the caſe under debate are) not limited to that particular deſigne, or battell, wherein the Prince hath the worſe, and his ſworn followers are fallen into the unjuſt parties hands, but to indure whileſt life laſts, and the Prince hath any ſervice for him, he hath not done what poſſibly he may yet do, nor hath he ſatisfied his Oath, ſo that it can demand no more of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath a new life given him of his conquering Enemy, and thence becomes bound to him.</hi> This is but a rhetoricall flouriſh, or complement, and hath no Logick in it, his life is the ſame it was, and therefore the man is ſtill under the ſame obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:117670:32"/> of his duty and oath which he was before under. If this Author can prove his life to be really another, I will grant an evacuation of all his former contracted obligations. And in truth although the cuſtome of War cals an Enemies ſparing of the life of a worſted perſon Mercy, yet if that perſons cauſe were good, though he hath found bad ſucceſſe, he hath not forfeited his life to his prevailing Enemy, neither is he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding or in debt to him for it, no more then a true man oweth his life to thoſe theeves that onely rob him; or a weak man is indebted for his life to a ſtrong man, becauſe he kils him not. 3ly. <hi>This is beſides, and not against the former Oath.</hi> 1. If it be not againſt it, you are beſides your undertaking, and prevaricate it, for you promiſed to ſhew how a man might take an Oath contrary to his former Oaths. 2. But it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the former, for to ſwear to do the utmoſt that can be for, the Prince, and to ſwear not to attempt any thing againſt that Princes Enemy which hath diſpoſſeſt him of his right can be no other then contraries. 4. <hi>It is impoſſible for him to be bound to an imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That which is in it ſelf, or in its own nature impoſſible, an oath cannot binde to; but that which is in it ſelf probable, and therefore promiſed under an Oath, may by accident, or by the interpoſition of ſome caſuall impediment become impoſſible, this is very ordinary, and this kinde of impoſſibility doth not diſſolve an Oath, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpends it for the time, untill the preſent impediment be removed: ſo that though the Oath binde not to the <hi>hic</hi> and <hi>nune</hi> of the accidentall impoſſibility, yet it ſtands in force ſtill, and obligeth to the thing is it is in it ſelf poſſible, and may (the obſtacle being removed) be hereafter fealible. 2.

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous thing for him to ſwear that he will attempt nothing for his party againſt the Enemy, for ſo he onely ſwears not to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:117670:33"/> attempt an Impoſſibility; and when this impoſſibility ceaſeth, the former Oath to his Prince taketh place: ſo that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Impoſſibility can be no warrant for ſuch a latter oath.</p>
            <p>Our Author in his Chap: 9. Sect. 3. thus oppoſeth the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Oaths: <hi>God ſaith, By me Princes reign: the governing Powers which are, are of God. God hath declared that he will chaſtiſe, and change Princes, and Governors; and when we ſee the changes and chastiſements, we may be ſure they are by Gods order, yea, though the invading or ſucceeding Governors be like</hi> Jehu, Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>or thoſe who by cruelty ſhew us nothing but Gods wrath. Wherefore it can be no leſſe then ſin in us, or treaſon againſt God, to ſwear we will never obey any, but this, or that Prince, or State, or any but of ſuch a Family: for this depends on Gods Providence and Juſtice, which ſets bounds to the duration of Governors, and Governments.</hi> 1. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all the Kings and Potentates of the Earth are ſet up and pulled down by God, and every change of Governors, even the advancement of thoſe who are heavie ſcourges to the people, is in a ſence by and from him; and it is as certain, that ſome Princes in ſome ſence are not of God, as is clear enough, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8.4. We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh thus. 1. A thing is ſaid to be of God, in that it was fore-ſeen, and pre-ordained of him before it came to paſſe; and falleth out by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſpoſall. And thus every act or event is by him, whether it be right, or wrong, agreeable or repugnant to his revealed will or Commandment: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.20. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. So are all thefts, robberies, oppreſſions, murthers, violent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions, and occupations. Thus even Antichriſts power that is derived to him by the divell is yet given him of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5.7.17.17. And ſo was <hi>Pilates</hi> power to crucifie Chriſt: <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.10, 11.2. To be of God, importeth the thing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, warranted or approved by his word, or revealed will; and thus <hi>Gamaliel</hi> uſeth the tearms, when he ſpeaks hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically of the Apoſtles preaching and working miracles. <hi>If it be of God,</hi> in oppoſition to that which is of men, although in the former acception nothing is of men, but it is of God alſo. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.38, 39. Now to diſcern what is of God, ſo as to impoſe upon us, we muſt not go to his ſecret will or providence, many things come about to us that way which we are not bound to embrace and acquieſce in, but may, yea ought to uſe remedy
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:117670:33"/> againſt, and ſtrive to avert, or remove, ſuch as are tentations to ſin, diſeaſes of the body, captivity, oppreſſion, diſhonour, defamation, and ſuch like. Theſe evils, albeit we are patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſubmiſſively to bear them for the preſent, as they come from Gods correcting hand, when they are come to paſſe; yet we are allowed and required to ſeek the preventing of them when threatned, and the removall of them when befallen; Unjuſtly advanced Magiſtrates are of this nature; A paſſive ſubmiſſion under whom as a divine caſtigation, whileſt we can finde no redreſſe, is expedient; but an embracement of them (as thoſe that are authoriſed and warranted by God) active obedience to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>em, and maintenance or ſupport of them (which is the matter in queſtion) cannot upon this ground be inferred as neceſſary. To do evill, becauſe it is in the power of our hand by Providence, or to perſwade others, or our ſelves to ſit down under intolerable wrongs, becauſe they are come to paſſe that way, is an ungodly and fooliſh conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Divine Providence, and of a late invention in theſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-way erring times.</p>

But the Apostle commands ſubmiſſion, and obedience, and that for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake unto thoſe that in his time came unlawfully into their power and authority. Ergo.</hi> The major will not be ſtood upon. The minor is to be denyed; And for his full confutation therein, and vindication of the Apoſtle in this text, I ſhall, 1. by way of <hi>Elenchus</hi> make good the contradictory to this Propoſition. 2. Anſwer what he brings for the maintenance of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then I am to clear this contradictory to his minor, <hi>viz: That the Apostle in commanding obedience to the higher powers, can onely be understood of ſuch as poſſeſſe their Authority lawfully, or have a just title, and regular calling thereunto.</hi> And this I ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to do out of the Apoſtles own words, or by the characters he gives of the Powers he would have obeyed.</p>

Otherwiſe the Apoſtle had ſaid no more for Magiſtrates in this Character then the Scripture ſaith of plagues, famines, and other judgements <note n="a" place="margin">Fanatici di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant poteſtates omnes ſic a Deo eſſe, ſicut peſtes, morbi, &amp; paenae a Deo ſunt.

            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Powers</hi> in this place, this Author tels us, <hi>he means not meerly power, or authority abſtracted from perſons, but perſons clothed with that Authority.</hi> Now that perſons clothed with Authority may be ſaid to be of God, there muſt be not onely Gods inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the office, or magiſtracy in the abſtract, for the meer ordaining of the office makes not this or that man a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate more then another, but alſo his ordering of the perſons to the office, but they that are thus ordered of God (<hi>viz:</hi> not providentially alone, but by way of vocation, approbation, and authorization, as it is above proved, the ſenſe of the words <hi>[of God]</hi> muſt import) to the Magiſtrates place, muſt needs be granted to be lawfully poſſeſt of it, or to have to it a juſt title. This univerſall negative therefore of the Apoſtle, <hi>There is no power but of God,</hi> muſt not be taken in the ſimply univerſal ſenſe, as if there were no other power in the world but ſuch, but as a reſtrained univerſall, to wit, <hi>There is no lawfull power but of

They that come in by meer force, with expulſion of the juſt Magiſtrate, have apparently committed this crime of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Power that is the ordinance of God, and ſo have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the ſentence of damnation, or condemnation (which may be underſtood of puniſhment by men) and its a ſtrange conceit to think, that the Apoſtle dosh here at once both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne their act, and confirm their authority gotten by it, and that the ſame perſons ſhould by the ſame means be both the reſiſters that are <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="4">4ly, The Power here to be obeyed, is <hi>the minister of God to thee, a revenger to execute wrath,</hi> &amp;c. v: 4. 1. No man can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a miniſter of God, but he that is called of God to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, wherein he is his Miniſter, not onely the office muſt be authorized, but the perſon muſt be inveſted with it by God; there muſt be ſome act of God, either immediately or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put forth towards the perſon, or this relation to him of being his Miniſter cannot be founded; now whoſoever is the ſubject of ſuch a divine act or vocation, hath without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie a juſt title to Magiſtracie. 2. He that is a Revenger to execute wrath under and for God, (that is not by providence onely, as thieves, robbers, and forrein invaders are, but by place and calling) not for deſtruction, but for good, he muſt receive a warrant from God for it: vengeance is Gods alone, by property, ſo that none can take it in hand but by deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him: others whatever power they have to do it, are expreſly prohibited to be avengers, immediately before this text, Chap. 12. 17. Now he that receives a warrant from God for it, is lawfully impowered.</p>
            <p>By every one of theſe Characters affixed by the Apoſtle, to the Magiſtracy ſpoken of in this text, it muſt needs be evinced, <hi>That the Apostle in commanding obedience to the higher Powers, can onely be underſtood of ſuch as poſſeſſe their Authority lawfully, or have a juſt title thereunto:</hi> and this is the contradictory to his Minor, which I undertook to make good.</p>

As for that which he hinteth on as if he would prove the minor by it, <hi>viz: this Epistle was written in the time of</hi> Claudius, <hi>or</hi> Nero, it hath no ſhadow of proof in it: for they were not the onely Powers then in being: there were others even among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes as wel as they, himſelf nameth the Conſuls, and Senate, as thoſe to whom the power of right belonged, and they were then exiſtent, and in ſome poſſeſſion and uſe of the power: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Emperours ruled with them, and in ſome things over-ruled them, as they were haply in other things ruled by them <note n="d" place="margin">Quinetiam ſpeciem quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam libertatis induxit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatis ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui &amp; Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratibus, &amp; maieſtate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinâ &amp; pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: neque tam parvum quidquam, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tam mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num publici privatique ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that <hi>Claudius</hi> came in (though croſſe to ſome unripened motions, and conſultations of theirs, yet) not againſt any Act or Decree of the Senate; but with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current or ſubſequent approbation.</p>
            <p>If it be objected in behalf of the Uſurpers in our caſe, that they alſo have a conſent of the people, by the act of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed Houſe of Commons. I anſwer, beſides what hath been ſaid in the cloſe of the firſt Chapter, of the peoples non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committance of any power to their Repreſentees, to alter any thing in the conſtitution of the Supreame Power, or to erect a new one; all that they have to do, being to manage that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which is committed to them: there are moreover two main things that impeach that Acts validity. 1. That the Lords who are an eminent integrall part of the Kingdom, as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:117670:38"/> alſo the far greater part of the elected Commons, are, not only abſent (ſo that a very ſmall part of the Kingdom, even locally conſidered is repreſented by them that ſit) but not permitted to come in, and profeſſedly ſhut out (and conſequently the parts of the Kingdom which they repreſent are excluded) at the paſſing of this conſent. 2. That the object and actors in this conſent, the promoted and promoters are the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; on whom is the new Supreme Power conferred, but on themſelves that confer it? You cannot finde two parties in this act, an agent, and a patient; ſo that it is ſo far from being a legitimate contract, or tranſaction, that it is no politicall act at all. What reckoning ſhall we make of that conſent which men beſtow on themſelves, in relation to an intereſt of power over others? if ſuch a grant could create a right, few men that could get ſtrength would lack preferment.</p>
            <p>Having thus anſwered this Authors main Argument, I ſhall in the reſt be briefer. 2. He alledgeth, <hi>In this Nation many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been ſettled in ſupreame Authority by meer force, without title of Inheritance, not any three immediately ſucceeding each other have come to the Crown by true lineall ſucceſſion. Five Kings on a row (the Conquerour being the firſt) had no title at all by proximity of blood,</hi> Hen: <hi>the</hi> 7th <hi>by meer power came in, was made King, in, and by an Army, upon this foundation of military power he got himſelf crowned at Westminster, and called a Parliament, wherein the Crown was entailed upon him, and his Heirs. Thoſe that came in thus, the main body of this Nation did obey, yea doth yeeld ſubjection unto their Laws to this day.</hi> Not to ſtand to examine what he aſſerts in theſe premiſes: 1. The miſtake of this Argument is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kings by him mentioned came not in by true ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or proximity of blood, they therefore muſt needs be granted to have come in by force alone, or otherwiſe unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; whereas though, ſome of them entred by the Sword, others by anticipation, yet they all, whoſe perſons were, and Laws now are obeyed, had the concurrent, or ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, and that without their Houſes being diſmembred, and a force ſet at their doores. 2. The Laws made by thoſe Princes were not made by them alone, but by them with the Parliament; and by them, not as ſo entring, but as received by Parliament,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:117670:39"/> and ſo legally inveſted. 3. The three laſt Princes of this Realm did come in by an indubitate lineall ſucceſſion, and proximity of blood, and the Son of the laſt is in being, and claiming by that title. It is obſervable then that this title ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and cut off, when it was at the cleareſt ſtate. 4. No doubt there have been unjuſtifyable proceedings about the Crown by ſome of the former poſſeſſors of it: which have been follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with remarkable puniſhments, and publick calamities ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently pointing out their injuſtice, and fore-warning others from making them their examples to practiſe by. What hath been, is no warrant to conſcience that the ſame may be done.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, <hi>He cites ſome Divines, and Caſuiſts as concurrent with him in his opinion.</hi> Their words are too many for me to recite, and the nature of this kinde of Argument exacteth no long An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. In a word therefore. 1. <hi>Azorius</hi> his words allow obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Tyrants in regard of title, with reſtriction, and in ſome caſes, (ſuch as are granted by me, Chap. 3d.) But your part is to prove obedience to them, in its full latitude as you have propounded your theſis, without limitation, and concluded (though not validly) by your firſt Argument.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Alſted</hi> diſtinguiſheth of <hi>Tyrannus, titulo, &amp; exercitio,</hi> a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in regard of title, and in regard of uſe: and his words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before theſe alledged by you are ſpoken of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo may therefore theſe be underſtood; but the former onely is the ſubject of our queſtion. Beſides within a few lines before he hath this paſſage: <hi>A Tyrant without title, who is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader, every private man may, and ought to deſtroy, for he is not a Prince but a private perſon</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Alſted: The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol: caſ cap. 17. reg. 8.</note>. Which wil not ſtand with the words quoted by you, if underſtood of a Tyrant in regard of title.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Paraeus</hi> in your place ſpeaks nothing <hi>pro,</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Uſurpers, but is explicating how the Apoſtle is to be taken in thoſe words, <hi>The powers that be, are of God, ordained of God:</hi> and he diſtinguiſhes thus in the words brought in by you. <hi>The power which is of God is one thing, the getting, and uſe of the power is another, which is indifferent, ſometimes lawfull, ſometimes unlawfull, ut in dublis</hi>

Par. in Rom. 13.</note>. Whither if you had followed him, you ſhould have found him anſwering the doubt about <hi>Nimrods</hi> power thus <hi>We must diſcern betwixt the power which is ever of God, and betwixt the getting and uſage of the power, which as to men is often

By which words it is evident, you have but half quoted him, as well as impertinently; and if his Authority may ſway with you, unjuſtly gotten power is not of God, in regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or man, owning it, and conſequently not to be obeyed by vertue of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For the reſt I have not their books to peruſe, but their ſayings ſet down by you reach not the caſe at all.

            <p n="4">4ly, His next Reaſon is, <hi>Either that authority which is thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by power muſt be obeyed, or elſe all Authority and Government muſt fall to the ground, and ſo confuſion be admitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, why muſt this needs follow? 1. May not Uſurpation fall to the ground, how ſtrongly ſoever it be ſet up, and lawfull Government be raiſed up again? The experience of former times hath obſerved, <hi>That no ill gotten power can be long lived</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly, If Uſurpation have a party to joyn with it, that party will ſuffice to adminiſter ſuch juſtice as that Authority will afford; if it have no party, it fals to the ground (for it ſubſiſts onely perforce) and a clear way is open for the right Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:117670:40"/> to take place: which will be ſo much the more readily entertained, by how much it hath been interrupted <note n="*" place="margin">Arciores autem morſus ſunt intermiſſae libertatis, quam tetentae. Cicero de offic. lib. 2.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, However things ſucceed, evill of ſin muſt not be done, that good of profit may be attained. It muſt firſt be proved lawfull to obey, before this Reaſon can be heard, which will onely plead its expediencie, if it be honeſt. Though <hi>commodum</hi> may be conſulted, eſpecially <hi>publicum,</hi> yet we muſt firſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the <hi>justum</hi> of it. It was not long ago pleaded, <hi>Fiat ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia, ruat coelum.</hi> And we were not told thus, when the late wars for Laws and Liberty were firſt begun: If this be a cogent reaſon now, it was to have been ſo then; and we might better have prevented the miſeries of a war by he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning to it, then by refuſing it, have, by ſo dear a means, purchaſed to our ſelves an harder condition, and now be bound to bide under it for that very reaſon.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, If Government fall, and Confuſion come, let them bear the guilt that have wrought theſe effects: we that detract from obedience ſhall onely bear the miſery of it, which will be lighter to us, it may be hoped, then their greatneſſe with the guilt it is gotten, and kept by, will be to them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, he addes, <hi>Otherwiſe the King being for the Common-wealth, and not the Common-wealth for the King, the end ſhould be destroyed for the means, the whole for a part.</hi> Firſt, the King as a man, yea as a royall perſon, or moſt noble part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, is not the prime matter to be layed on the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; but if the King may be lookt at as ours, and ſo as we are in piety, and juſtice bound to him, to ſeek his preſervation, and yeeld him our obedience; thus conſidering him, equity and a good conſcience are the things ſtood for as the end; which although they may undergo the notion of means in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Common-wealths good, yet they are deſirable, and to be ſought abſolutely, and for themſelves; and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate means of the Common-wealths politicall good, muſt be ſubordinated or ſubmitted to them, and that end is onely ſo far, and by ſuch means to be purſued, as will conſiſt with theſe. 2ly, The Parliament, and the Army alſo, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> no more then a means, or a part in relation to the collective Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. Muſt not the rights of theſe therefore be ſtood for, with the hazard of the whole? If this rule might have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:117670:40"/> guided men in relation to their claims, ſuch courſes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents as have been, had been prevented. 3ly, Though certain deſtruction of the end, or whole, muſt not be run upon for the means, or part, yet thoſe may be hazarded for the ſaving of theſe from certain deſtruction. As we ſee it ordinarily, men do adventure their lives and liberties for the preſervation, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their eſtates by war; and their whole bodies for the regaining of their healths, or one wounded, or feſtered mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by Phyſick or Chyrurgery. 4ly, We are not active in the deſtroying of the end, or whole (if they be deſtroyed) and we were better both to ſuffer their deſtruction, and ſuffer in it, then ſinfully to concur in deſtroying the means, or a part, or in ſubſtituting an unlawfull means, or part for the legitimate, that we might preſerve them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>If a masters mate had thrown the master over-board, and by power would ſuffer no other to guide the ſhip but himſelf, if the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners will not obey him, commanding aright for the guiding of the ſhip, the ſhip and themſelves muſt needs periſh.</hi> 1. I conceive the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners may in this caſe obey the Maſters Mate for ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, till they come to ſhore; in like manner that we may obey an Uſurpers power, that is, act according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in a thing which is not onely lawfull, but ſimply neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie both to be done, and to be done by us, as in the caſe of ſelf-preſervation, by repelling a forrain Enemy, or common danger of certain and important conſequence; but ſhall it be inferred from hence, that the marriners are bound to obey the Mate, or we an Uſurper, in all other things of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, or ſeparable from ſelf-preſervation, and every other neceſſary duty. I am bound to ſubmit my ſelfe to the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and neceſſary direction of my Paſtor, and Phyſician in their reſpective ordering, touching my ſoul and body: muſt I ſay therefore I muſt reſigne up my ſelf in obedience to them in all other matters? 2ly, The caſe is not parallel. For, 1. The mariners (without reſpect to their exigence) in that poſture are bound to obey none, the Maſter being dead, and ſo are conſcience free. But the people (in the caſe) have a Magiſtrate ſurviving, and challenging power over them, to whom they have ſworn Allegiance. 2ly, The Mariners are ſuppoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obedience to the Mate, to be ſure of deſtruction: but by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:117670:41"/> what hath been above ſaid, it cannot be pleaded that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the ſcruplers at obedience without obeying are ſure to periſh.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, you quote a ſaying out of <hi>Cajetan</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Summula. Tit. Rempub. Tyrannice, &amp;c.</note>, but it ſuits not with the obedience you ſtand for; he in all that Diſcourſe ſpeaks nothing at all for any obedience to Tyrants in reſpect of title, his ſubject being the point of going to ſuch Tyrants for Law and Juſtice <note n="y" place="margin">Nunquid gubernanto Tyranno pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent illi qui recurrunt ad ipſum pro ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia.</note>, (of which I have ſpoken Chap. 3.) and his whole ſpeech being confined to it.</p>
            <p>Eightly, laſtly, (for I will not follow you in repeating again what you had ſaid before, and I have anſwered above) <hi>What can the common people do in this caſe? they cannot judge of titles; but they ſee who doth viſibly, and actually exerciſe Authority.</hi> 1. Bruit beaſts do indeed onely ſee him that actually leads, or drives them; and therefore they follow without making difference betwixt the owner and a thief: but are men, though but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people ſo ſtupid? The people you ſpeak of are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo bruitiſh, they themſelves diſprove you, if you obſerve (as it is eaſie to diſcern) whom they generally abhor from, and whom they look towards: and whoſo ſhall compare their viſible bent with your preſent book, they whom you make but like <hi>Balaams</hi> dumb Aſſe, yet in this caſe do ſpeak with mans voice, and forbid the madneſſe, &amp;c. 2ly, If they be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of diſcerning of titles, wherefore hath not onely the late King, but the Parliament publiſhed ſo many Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Appeals to the people, wherein they plead for the juſtneſſe of their title, to what they ſtood and fought for? yea why hath the Parliament drawn the people into the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the 2d. Vow, and Oath, and the Solemne League and Covenant, all which concern the ſeverall claims and rights of King and Parliament? either they are thereby ſuppoſed to be ſomewhat competent to judge of thoſe titles; or it was both vainly, and irreligiouſly done to lead them into ſuch ſacred bonds, which we may neither take, nor cauſe others to take, but in judgement. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, Although they, yea the primeſt Stateſmen, may finde it difficult enough to judge of titles in ſome nice, and intricate caſes that may happen, yet the preſent caſe is not ſo deep or doubtfull, the right of title in this queſtion is written with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117670:41"/> clear and capitall letters, in Laws, Oaths, and actions open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all. Yea this Author in the title and current of his book, (as doth Mr. <hi>Aſhcam</hi> in his) plainly enough grants where the right of title is.</p>
            <p>This Author in the latter end of a ſecond Edition of his book, <hi>viz:</hi> beginning at pag. 15. addeth ſome things <hi>upon the question of active obedience, and acting under this preſent power, and government.</hi> Although this Edition come in late, and in ſome paſſages is but an amplification in tearms, not in matter, of what he had ſaid before; yet I ſhall take a brief notice (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufficient let the Reader judge) of the things in it, that may ſeem materiall.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he premiſeth, <hi>That the preſent Power is in poſſeſſion of the whole Land, and no viſible force to oppoſe, and ſo it is not like that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Abſolom, <hi>when</hi> David <hi>had an Army in view.</hi> Conſult the text, and you ſhall finde the caſe exactly parallel. 1. <hi>The preſent Power is in poſſeſſion of the whole Land;</hi> you ſay, you mean of this ſide the Sea, not of <hi>Ireland</hi> alſo; ſutable hereunto <hi>Abſolom</hi> was poſſeſt of all the Land unto <hi>Jordan,</hi> yea, and he went over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and pitched in <hi>Gilead,</hi> and all the people throughout all the Tribes of Iſrael had anointed him King over them: on the other hand <hi>David</hi> and his men <hi>fled out of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and out of the Land, beyond Jordan, and ſtayed not till he came to Mahanaim by the ford Jabock.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.14, &amp;c. 17.22.24, 25, 26.19.9, 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, You adde, <hi>And no viſible Force to oppoſe, whereas</hi> David <hi>had an Army in view. David</hi> had no Army in view within that land before ſpoken of: all that he had was at <hi>Mahanaim.</hi> And though there be no viſible Force to oppoſe in <hi>England,</hi> yet there is ſaid to be a conſiderable Force in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and it may appear by the Preparations ſent thither. Beſides there is one thing indeed wherein <hi>Davids</hi> condition, and his whom the preſent Power excludeth, differ, but not to the advantage of this Authors Reaſon, which is, that <hi>David</hi> had no other Kingdom to own, and declare for him, which yet he hath.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You come with Arguments. 1. <hi>Obedience to ſuch a Power in good things is lawfull. But acting for Juſtice and order is a good thing: Ergo:</hi> I have before diſtinguiſht betwixt morall acts which are for private men to do, though there were no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117670:42"/> and politicall acts, which flow from magiſtracy. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of acts may not be done in obedience to an uſurped Power, for the Reaſons given before. The execution of juſtice is a good act in it ſelf, but it is not good to be done by every man, nor upon every mans command; but is onely good in him that is lawfully authorized to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, You ſay, what reaſon is it, that thoſe that will not act becauſe they hold it unlawfull, ſhould expect that others ſhould do an unlawfull act to benefit them? To this let <hi>Cajetan</hi> (an Author cited by you, and that in the place you cited from him) anſwer you; <hi>They are excuſed from the ſin of inducing the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to an act unlawfull for him, that ask Justice of him, becauſe they do not petition him for the unlawfull act, but for the justice of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull act: it is honestly done to perſwade him to uſe his power leſſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. This Petition is in effect thus much. Seeing thou wilt-hold and exerciſe this power, uſe it justly, uſe it honeſtly, uſe it religiouſly; uſe it to the benefit of the publick, and of private men, as it would become the Power. It is plain ſuch Petitioners intend not to ask the Tyrant to uſurp the act of Judicature, becauſe they had rather he would give it over: but ſeeing he doth uſurp dominion, and judgement, they intend he ſhould uſe juſtly and honeſtly his uſurped Power and Judgement: and that which they intend, that they petition for: ſo that they neither intend nor peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for and uſurped act, but an holy quality in the exerciſing of that uſurped act</hi>

            <p>Again, <hi>Why ſhould others give right to them, that will not give right to others?</hi> A fallacious, and frivolous interrogation in the true meaning of it. In commutative juſtice (wherein the rule of doing as we would be done unto) onely holds, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to perſons that are to do it) they who refuſe magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall acts, are ready to render every mans right to him. But this queſtion would have a private man (ſuch as they are) to have no diſtributive juſtice, or right by the Magiſtrate done him, even when the Magiſtrate is lawfull, becauſe he cannot,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:117670:42"/> and therfore will not <hi>viciſſim</hi> adminiſter diſtributive juſtice to the Magiſtrate. Every common Judgement knows that a private ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is to receive judiciall right, but not to give it.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, <hi>It is cleared before in this Diſcourſe, that thoſe who have gotten to be Powers (though by force) ought to give justice to thoſe whoſe government they have undertaken, but (ſuppoſing them to be but one, or a few) this they cannot do without ſubordinate agents; to diſallow acting under them then, is to ſay in effect they ſhall not give justice.</hi> 1. Suppoſe them but one or a few, and they cannot get or keep the place by force. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them many, &amp; they have no need (in that reſpect) of others to be their under-agents. 2ly, If this that you ſay be cleared, or ſo much as ſaid before, I have forgotten it, though I have read all that is before, and reſt confident there is no ſuch thing. When you ſhew where this is ſaid and cleared, I ſhall then find by what reaſons it is maintained, and ſo give you an Anſwer thereunto. In the mean time, that which is here but barely affirmed, it is ſufficient for me to deny. If you could clear this, the whole que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion were decided. If he ought to give juſtice, he hath a ſpeciall warrant, and calling to it, and how Force can give ſuch a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you have not yet aſlayed to clear, the contrary I have brought many reaſons for (Chapter 2.) and am therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand with you in this point. It will be confeſt, that if a man will take upon him to adminiſter judgement he were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or it is a leſſe evill in him, to do right, then wrong therein: but of two evils of ſin, neither is to be admitted.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, <hi>This Doctrine of not acting is the very doctrine of Levelling. For when no man may act, every man may take freely from his neighbour, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Levelling may be the conſequent of non-acting, but it cannot be the conſequent of it; it is the conſequence of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> doings, who take away the ſettled Magiſtracy. 2. Levelling in point of goods, you like not it ſeems: but why do you not as well abhor from it in point of Government? that's but levelling the private, this is levelling the publick Intereſt; that Levelling can never come in, till this Levelling go before, and lead the way, but who are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers this latter, and (as you ſee) worſe way, but they that teach, or practiſe the deſerting of the lawfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, eſtabliſht Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and the competency, yea duty, of any that have force to play the Magiſtrate. <hi>Hence ariſeth that which they cal an interpretative conſent of the people: becauſe it is ſuppoſed every rationall man doth conſent that there ſhould be order, property, and right, given under a tyrant, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117670:43"/> then all to be under confuſion, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Every rationall man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents indeed that there ſhould be order, property and right; and his being under a tyrant (by experience of the want) confirms his conſent to the neceſſity thereof: but that ſuch things ſhould be maintained magiſtratically by a tyrant (in regard of title) you ſee (if all that are your Antagoniſts in this queſtion be not ſtark Irrationals) ſome rationall men deny. And in this they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear rationall, in that they would hear ſome reaſon for it, before they conſent to it. Which rather then you will ſtrain yourſelf to give (for truly it is hard to do) you chooſe to ſuppoſe them that will not conſent without it, to be out of the number of rationall men. 2ly, This ſhift of an interpretative conſent of the people, that the Uſurper ſhall adminiſter judgement, will not ſerve you. For, 1. It will be difficult to finde out, and agree, when ſuch an interpretative conſent is given by the people. 2ly, What thing is it? as near as I can conjecture it is poſſibly. 1. Either that theſe men ſhall be the Power, or Magiſtrate; and then, 1. Either the people had power to give this conſent, and this makes theſe men no U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers, but lawfull Magiſtrates, &amp; ſo puts them out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of this queſtion. 2. Or they had no power, being pre-inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and then this conſent is void, and null, becauſe it prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates anothers right. 2. Or it is, that theſe men, though they have no conſent of theirs to be Magiſtrates, but come in, and hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wils, and by their own meer force, and againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right, yet they ſhall for preſent execute judgement, becauſe it cannot be had otherwayes. This conſent (ſuppoſe it really paſt by the people) cannot bottome their acting, or others under them. For it is in the eſſence of it an unlawfull act, and therefore of no force. It is of the ſame validity as was that of the people which joyned with <hi>Korah,</hi> and his company, who gave conſent, that though <hi>Korah,</hi> and the reſt were no Prieſts, yet they ſhould offer incenſe; or as that would be, if the people of a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now, that can procure no lawfull Miniſter, ſhould take a private man, and ſay, this man is no Miniſter, yet he ſhall, in this defect of one, preach, and adminiſter the Sacraments to us. Such conſents are contradictions to the eſtabliſht ordinance of God, appointing that no ſtranger to thoſe functions ſhal execute thoſe acts. In like ſort it is in this point of Magiſtracy.</p>

This accuſation would import to us, his Anſwer under queſtion to have been ſo poſitive, and punctuall, for tribute paying; for though no doubt theſe men accuſed him maliciouſly, and would not ſtick to do it falſly, yet they would have ſome hint, or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of occaſion for it, as in other their accuſations they by ſtraining, and miſconſtruction had.</p>
